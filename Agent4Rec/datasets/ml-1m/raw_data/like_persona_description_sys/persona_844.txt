MOVIE: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977); WATCH: yes; REASON: I have always been intrigued by the Star Wars franchise and its impact on popular culture. I enjoy science fiction and epic adventures, so I believe this movie will align with my taste; FEELING: After watching Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, I can understand why it is considered a classic. The world-building, the characters, and the iconic soundtrack all contributed to an immersive and thrilling experience. I can see why it has such a dedicated fan base. However, as someone who is not deeply invested in the Star Wars universe, I found some parts of the story confusing and the pacing a bit slow at times.
