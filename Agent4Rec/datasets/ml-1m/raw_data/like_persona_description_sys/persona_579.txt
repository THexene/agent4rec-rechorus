MOVIE: Lion King, The (1994); WATCH: yes; REASON: I appreciate movies with unique storytelling techniques and I have a diverse taste in movies; FEELING: The Lion King was a visually stunning and emotionally captivating film. The animation was breathtaking, and the story of Simba's journey to reclaim his throne was both heartwarming and inspiring.
