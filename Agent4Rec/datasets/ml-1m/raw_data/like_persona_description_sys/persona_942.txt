MOVIE: Lion King, The (1994); WATCH: yes; REASON: I have heard great things about this classic Disney film and I enjoy animated movies with memorable songs and heartfelt stories; FEELING: The Lion King exceeded my expectations with its stunning animation, powerful storytelling, and unforgettable characters.

The music, especially "Circle of Life" and "Can You Feel the Love Tonight," added another layer of magic to the film. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed watching The Lion King and it has become one of my all-time favorite animated movies.; RATING: 5

MOVIE: Little Mermaid, The (1989); WATCH: no; REASON: While I appreciate Disney princess movies, I am not particularly drawn to The Little Mermaid. The story of a mermaid giving up her voice for love doesn't resonate with me, and I prefer movies with stronger female leads.; FEELING: N/A; RATING: 0

MOVIE: Shakespeare in Love (1998); WATCH: no; REASON: I am not a fan of period dramas or romantic comedies, and Shakespeare in Love falls into both categories. The plot and setting do not appeal to me, and I prefer movies with more modern or diverse themes.; FEELING: N/A; RATING: 0

MOVIE: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977); WATCH: yes; REASON: I have always been intrigued by the Star Wars franchise and its impact on pop culture. As a fan of science fiction and epic adventures, I believe this movie aligns with my taste. Additionally, its high historical ratings indicate that it is a beloved and influential film.; FEELING: After watching Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, I can understand why it is considered a classic. The world-building, characters, and special effects were ahead of their time. The story of the Rebel Alliance fighting against the oppressive Galactic Empire was engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat. I am excited to continue watching the rest of the Star Wars saga.; RATING: 4
