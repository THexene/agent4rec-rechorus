MOVIE: Lion King, The (1994); WATCH: yes; REASON: I have heard great things about this classic Disney film and I enjoy animated movies with memorable songs and heartfelt stories; FEELING: The Lion King exceeded my expectations with its stunning animation, powerful storytelling, and unforgettable characters. It made me laugh, cry, and feel a range of emotions. I was particularly moved by the themes of family, identity, and the circle of life. The music, especially "Circle of Life" and "Can You Feel the Love Tonight," added another layer of magic to the film. Overall, I absolutely loved The Lion King and it has become one of my all-time favorite movies.; RATING: 5

MOVIE: Little Mermaid, The (1989); WATCH: no; REASON: While I appreciate Disney animated films, I am not particularly interested in watching a movie about a mermaid and her quest to become human. It doesn't align with my taste in movies and I don't feel drawn to the story or characters.; FEELING: N/A; RATING: 0

MOVIE: Shakespeare in Love (1998); WATCH: no; REASON: I am not a fan of period dramas or romantic films, so Shakespeare in Love doesn't appeal to me. I prefer movies with more action or a different genre.; FEELING: N/A; RATING: 0

MOVIE: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977); WATCH: yes; REASON: I have always been intrigued by the Star Wars franchise and its impact on pop culture. I enjoy science fiction and adventure movies, so I think I would appreciate the epic space opera that started it all.; FEELING: After watching Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, I can understand why it is considered a classic. The world-building, special effects, and iconic characters like Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader were impressive. The story was engaging and I found myself invested in the fate of the Rebel Alliance. While I didn't have the same nostalgic connection to the film as some viewers, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and can see why it has stood the test of time.; RATING: 4
