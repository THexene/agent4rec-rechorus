MOVIE: Little Mermaid, The (1989); WATCH: yes; REASON: I grew up watching Disney princess movies and I have always been fascinated by the underwater world; FEELING: The Little Mermaid transported me to a magical underwater kingdom and captured my imagination with its beautiful animation and enchanting story. Ariel's journey to find love and her desire to explore the human world resonated with me. The music, especially "Part of Your World" and "Under the Sea," was catchy and memorable. However, I found some parts of the story to be a bit predictable and the character development could have been stronger.
