TASTE: Romantic and Charming
REASON: Movies like "Shakespeare in Love" and "My Life So Far" captivated me with their romantic themes and charming characters, leading to a positive rating.

TASTE: Artistic and Cinematic
REASON: "Jean de Florette" and "Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker" impressed me with their visually stunning cinematography and artistic storytelling, resulting in a high rating.

TASTE: Intense and Thrilling
REASON: I rated "Boxing Helena" highly because it offered a suspenseful and intense viewing experience that kept me engaged throughout.

Based on your movie-rating history, I have observed the following tendencies:

HIGH RATINGS: You tend to give high ratings to movies that are dramatic, emotional, quirky, offbeat, romantic, charming, artistic, cinematic, intense, and thrilling.

LOW RATINGS: You have not given any movies a rating below 2, so there is no conclusion to be drawn about movies of low ratings.

Please note that these conclusions are based solely on your movie-rating history and may not necessarily reflect your preferences in other genres or categories.
