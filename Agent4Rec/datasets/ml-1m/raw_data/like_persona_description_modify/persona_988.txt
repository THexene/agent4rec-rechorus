As a movie taste analyst, based on your movie-rating history, I have generated the following TASTE-REASON pairs:

TASTE: I enjoy romantic dramas.
REASON: I gave high ratings to movies like "Notting Hill" and "Pretty Woman" which are known for their romantic storylines.

TASTE: I appreciate classic films.
REASON: I rated movies like "Gone with the Wind" and "North by Northwest" highly, which are considered timeless classics.

TASTE: I have a preference for historical epics.
REASON: I gave a high rating to "Spartacus" and "Saving Private Ryan," both of which are set in historical periods and depict epic events.

TASTE: I have a fondness for heartwarming and emotional movies.
REASON: I rated "Ordinary People," "My Life as a Dog," and "Life Is Beautiful" highly, all of which are known for their emotional depth and touching stories.

TASTE: I enjoy character-driven dramas.
REASON: I gave high ratings to "Moonstruck," "Princess Bride, The," and "Five Easy Pieces," which are all known for their strong character development.

Now, let's analyze your tendencies in giving high and low ratings:

HIGH RATINGS: You tend to give high ratings to movies that fall into genres such as romantic dramas, classic films, historical epics, heartwarming and emotional movies, and character-driven dramas.

LOW RATINGS: Based on your rating history, it seems that you have not given any movies a rating below 2. Therefore, it is difficult to determine specific genres or types of movies that you tend to rate poorly.

Please note that these conclusions are based solely on the provided movie-rating history and may not necessarily reflect your current preferences.
