Now, let's analyze your tendencies in giving high and low ratings:

LOW RATINGS: On the other hand, you tend to give low ratings (below 2) to movies that may not align with your preferred genres or fail to engage you emotionally. You may not enjoy movies that solely focus on horror or lack a strong storyline.
