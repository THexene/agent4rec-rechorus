TASTE: Coming-of-age and Romance
REASON: I gave high ratings to movies like Pretty in Pink, Flashdance, and Jean de Florette because I enjoy movies that explore themes of love, growth, and self-discovery.

TASTE: Action and Sci-Fi
REASON: I gave high ratings to movies like Ghostbusters, Chariots of Fire, and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial because I am a fan of action-packed and science fiction films.

Based on the user's movie-rating history, I have observed the following tendencies:

HIGH RATINGS: The user tends to give high ratings (above 3) to movies that fall into genres such as adventure, comedy, drama, thriller, family, fantasy, coming-of-age, romance, action, and sci-fi. They appreciate movies that offer excitement, humor, intense storytelling, and imaginative worlds.

LOW RATINGS: The user tends to give low ratings (below 2) to movies that have not been mentioned in their rating history. Therefore, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the types of movies they dislike or rate poorly.

Please note that the conclusions are based solely on the provided movie-rating history and may not reflect the user's complete movie preferences.
