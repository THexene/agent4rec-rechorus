As a movie taste analyst, I have analyzed the user's movie-rating history and generated the following TASTE-REASON pairs:

TASTE: Thrilling and Suspenseful
REASON: I rated movies like "Twelve Monkeys," "Silence of the Lambs," and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" highly because I enjoy thrilling and suspenseful movies.

TASTE: Emotional and Thought-Provoking
REASON: I gave high ratings to movies such as "Good Will Hunting," "American History X," and "American Beauty" because they evoke strong emotions and provoke deep thoughts.

TASTE: Classic and Nostalgic
REASON: I rated "Mary Poppins" highly because it is a classic movie that brings back nostalgic memories.

TASTE: Horror and Supernatural
REASON: I gave high ratings to movies like "Halloween" and "The Exorcist" because I enjoy horror and supernatural genres.

Now, let's analyze the user's tendencies in giving high and low ratings:

HIGH RATINGS: The user tends to give high ratings (above 3) to movies that are thrilling, suspenseful, emotional, thought-provoking, classic, nostalgic, and fall under the horror and supernatural genres.

LOW RATINGS: The user has not given any low ratings (below 2) based on the provided movie-rating history.

Please note that these conclusions are based solely on the given movie-rating history and may not reflect the user's preferences for all movies.
