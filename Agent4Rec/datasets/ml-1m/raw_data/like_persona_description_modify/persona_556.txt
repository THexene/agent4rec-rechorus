As a movie taste analyst, I have analyzed the user's movie-rating history and generated the following TASTE-REASON pairs:

TASTE: I enjoy historical dramas.
REASON: I gave high ratings to movies like Malcolm X, Saving Private Ryan, and Patriot, which are all set in historical contexts.

TASTE: I appreciate action-packed science fiction.
REASON: I rated movies like Men in Black, X-Men, and Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi highly, as they are thrilling science fiction films with intense action sequences.

TASTE: I have a preference for thought-provoking dramas.
REASON: The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful drama that made me give it a high rating. It explores themes of hope and redemption, which resonated with me.

Now, let's analyze the user's tendencies in giving high and low ratings:
