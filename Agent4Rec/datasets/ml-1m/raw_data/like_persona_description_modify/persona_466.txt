As an analyst, I have analyzed the user's movie-rating history and generated the following TASTE-REASON pairs:

TASTE: Action-packed thrillers
REASON: I rated movies like Broken Arrow and Dead Man Walking with a 3 and 4 respectively because I enjoy the excitement and suspense that comes with action-packed thrillers.

TASTE: Heartwarming dramas
REASON: I gave a rating of 3 to Dead Poets Society and a rating of 5 to Good Will Hunting because I appreciate the emotional depth and thought-provoking storytelling in heartwarming dramas.

TASTE: Classic and timeless movies
REASON: I rated movies like Casablanca and Wizard of Oz with a 4 because I have a taste for classic and timeless films that have stood the test of time.

TASTE: Animated family movies
REASON: Pocahontas and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial received ratings of 3 and 4 respectively because I enjoy animated family movies that can be enjoyed by both children and adults.

TASTE: Psychological thrillers
REASON: Silence of the Lambs and Rain Man received ratings of 5 and 4 respectively because I am drawn to psychological thrillers that challenge my mind and keep me on the edge of my seat.

Now, let's analyze the user's tendencies for high and low ratings:

HIGH RATINGS: The user tends to give high ratings (above 3) to movies that offer excitement, emotional depth, timeless appeal, and psychological thrill. They appreciate action-packed thrillers, heartwarming dramas, classic movies, and psychological thrillers.

LOW RATINGS: The user has not given any ratings below 2, so we cannot draw any conclusions about their tendencies for low ratings.

Please note that these conclusions are based solely on the given movie-rating history and may not necessarily reflect the user's preferences in their entirety.
