HIGH RATINGS: The user tends to give high ratings (above 3) to classic films, dramas, historical films, comedies, mystery/thrillers, adventure/fantasy movies, and family films.

LOW RATINGS: The user has not given any ratings below 2, so it is difficult to determine specific genres or types of movies that they tend to rate poorly.
