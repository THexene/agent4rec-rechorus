TASTE: Family-friendly and adventurous
REASON: I gave movies such as "Stuart Little," "Thomas Crown Affair," "Erin Brockovich," "Doctor Dolittle," and "Mission: Impossible 2" a rating of 4 because I appreciate movies that offer a mix of adventure and family-friendly entertainment.

TASTE: Classic and nostalgic
