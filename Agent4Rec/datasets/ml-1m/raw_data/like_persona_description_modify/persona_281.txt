TASTE: I enjoy classic movies with a touch of mystery and suspense.

TASTE: I enjoy thought-provoking and artistic films.

Now, let's analyze your tendencies when it comes to giving high and low ratings:

HIGH RATINGS: You tend to give high ratings (above 3) to movies that fall into genres such as mystery, suspense, drama, sports, thought-provoking, artistic, and comedy. You appreciate well-crafted narratives, strong performances, and movies that evoke emotions.

LOW RATINGS: You tend to give low ratings (below 2) to movies that may not align with your preferred genres or fail to engage you. It is possible that you are not a fan of movies that are outside of your preferred genres or lack the qualities that you appreciate, such as weak storytelling or unconvincing performances.

Please note that these conclusions are based solely on your movie-rating history and may not necessarily reflect your current preferences.
