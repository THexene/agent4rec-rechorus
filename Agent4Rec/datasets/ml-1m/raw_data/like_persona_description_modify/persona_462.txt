Now, let's analyze the user's tendencies in giving high and low ratings:

HIGH RATINGS: The user tends to give high ratings (above 3) to movies that fall into genres such as action, sci-fi, classics, thrillers, superhero, and western. These genres provide the user with excitement, escapism, and engaging storytelling.

LOW RATINGS: On the other hand, the user tends to give low ratings (below 2) to movies that may not align with their preferred genres or fail to captivate their interest. It is evident from the ratings given to movies like Jaws 3-D, Speed 2: Cruise Control, and U.S. Marshalls.

Overall, the user's movie taste leans towards genres like action, sci-fi, classics, thrillers, superhero, and western, while they may not enjoy movies that do not align with these preferences.
