As an AI language model, I can help you analyze your movie taste based on your rating history. Here are some TASTE-REASON pairs that describe your movie preferences:

TASTE: I enjoy sci-fi and action movies.
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like "Dark City," "Mad Max 2," "Romeo Must Die," "Gattaca," "Star Trek: First Contact," "Die Hard," and "Jackie Chan's First Strike."

TASTE: I appreciate crime and thriller movies.
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like "Reservoir Dogs," "Hard-Boiled," "Professional, The," and "Usual Suspects, The."

TASTE: I have a liking for classic and iconic movies.
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like "Godfather, The," "Rocky," "Sting, The," and "Princess Bride, The."

TASTE: I enjoy spy and espionage movies.
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like "Thunderball" and "Usual Suspects, The."

Now, let's analyze your tendencies in giving high and low ratings:

HIGH RATINGS: You tend to give high ratings (above 3) to movies that fall into genres such as sci-fi, action, crime, thriller, classic, iconic, and spy movies. These genres seem to resonate with your preferences.

LOW RATINGS: Based on your rating history, it appears that you have not given any movies a rating below 2. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the types of movies you tend to rate poorly.

Please note that these conclusions are based solely on your rating history and may not necessarily reflect your current preferences.
