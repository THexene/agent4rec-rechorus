TASTE: Adventure and Fantasy
REASON: I enjoy movies like "Legend," "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea," and "7th Voyage of Sinbad" that transport me to imaginative worlds filled with mythical creatures and epic quests.

TASTE: Comedy and Coming-of-Age
REASON: I love movies like "Big," "Splash," and "The Breakfast Club" that combine humor with relatable stories of personal growth and self-discovery.
