As a movie taste analyst, I have analyzed your movie-rating history and identified two specific and inclusive taste-reason pairs for you:

TASTE: I have a preference for psychological thrillers and dramas.
REASON: This is evident from your high ratings for movies like "American Beauty," "Girl, Interrupted," and "Fight Club," which are known for their intense psychological themes and gripping storytelling.

TASTE: I enjoy action-packed movies with a mix of comedy and adventure.
REASON: This can be seen from your positive ratings for movies like "Shanghai Noon," "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," and "Independence Day (ID4)." These films offer a combination of thrilling action sequences, humor, and exciting adventures.

Please note that these taste-reason pairs are based on the genres and themes of the movies you have rated highly, without using any time-related or obscure words.
