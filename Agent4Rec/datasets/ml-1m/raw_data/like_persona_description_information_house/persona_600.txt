As a movie taste analyst, I have analyzed your movie-rating history and identified two specific and most inclusive taste-reason pairs for you:

TASTE: Science Fiction Enthusiast
REASON: You have consistently given high ratings to movies like "Blade Runner," "Gattaca," and "Forbidden Planet," which are all science fiction films. This suggests that you have a strong preference for movies set in futuristic or otherworldly settings, exploring advanced technology, and often dealing with philosophical or ethical themes.

TASTE: Dark Comedy Lover
REASON: Your high ratings for movies like "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" and "Network" indicate a preference for dark comedies. These films often use satire and humor to tackle serious and controversial topics, such as political satire and media manipulation. Your appreciation for these movies suggests that you enjoy thought-provoking and unconventional humor.

Please note that these taste-reason pairs are based on the genres and themes of the movies you have rated highly.
