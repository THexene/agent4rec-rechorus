TASTE: Action and Thriller
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and U-571, which are all action-packed and thrilling. These movies keep me on the edge of my seat with their intense and adrenaline-pumping sequences.

TASTE: Adventure and Historical
REASON: I enjoy movies that take me on exciting adventures and explore historical settings. Films like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Lawrence of Arabia, and The Adventures of Robin Hood captivate me with their thrilling quests and rich historical backdrops. I love being transported to different eras and experiencing the excitement of these epic journeys.
