REASON: This is evident from my high ratings for movies like "Jesus' Son," "Exorcist," "Magnolia," "Breaking the Waves," and "Dancer in the Dark." These films explore deep emotions, complex characters, and often deal with heavy themes.

TASTE: I enjoy offbeat and unconventional movies.
REASON: This can be seen in my positive ratings for films like "Almost Famous," "Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle," "American Movie," "Bicycle Thief," "But I'm a Cheerleader," "Wonder Boys," "Sweet and Lowdown," "Beyond the Mat," and "Big Kahuna." These movies offer unique storytelling, quirky characters, and unexpected plot twists.
