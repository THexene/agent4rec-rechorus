TASTE: Sci-Fi Enthusiast
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like Stargate, X-Files: Fight the Future, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Titan A.E., and 2001: A Space Odyssey, which are all science fiction films. This indicates my preference for movies that explore futuristic concepts, space exploration, and extraterrestrial encounters.

TASTE: Action-Adventure Fan
REASON: I have also given high ratings to movies like Mad Max, Predator, Men in Black, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, Face/Off, Independence Day (ID4), and X-Men. These movies are known for their thrilling action sequences, intense battles, and adventurous storylines. This suggests that I enjoy movies that combine action and adventure elements to create an exciting viewing experience.
