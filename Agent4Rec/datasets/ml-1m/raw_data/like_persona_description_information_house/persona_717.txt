As a movie taste analyst, I have analyzed your rating history and identified two specific and inclusive taste-reason pairs for you:

TASTE: I have a preference for thrilling and action-packed movies.
REASON: Based on your high ratings for movies like "Cliffhanger" and "Apollo 13," it seems that you enjoy movies that offer intense and adrenaline-pumping experiences.

TASTE: I appreciate movies with a touch of fantasy and adventure.
REASON: Your high ratings for movies like "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" and "All Dogs Go to Heaven" suggest that you have a fondness for movies that transport you to imaginative worlds and take you on exciting journeys.

Please note that these taste-reason pairs are based on the genres and themes of the movies you have rated highly, without using any time-related or obscure words.
