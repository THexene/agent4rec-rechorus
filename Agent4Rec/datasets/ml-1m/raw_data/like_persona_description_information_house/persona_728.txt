As a movie taste analyst, I have analyzed your movie-rating history and identified two specific and inclusive taste-reason pairs for you:

TASTE: Thrilling and suspenseful
REASON: You gave high ratings to movies like Scream 3 and Airport '77, which are known for their intense and suspenseful plots. This suggests that you enjoy movies that keep you on the edge of your seat with thrilling storylines.

TASTE: Quirky and offbeat
REASON: Your high ratings for movies like Bringing Out the Dead and Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo indicate a preference for movies with unconventional and offbeat themes. These movies often have unique characters and storylines that deviate from the mainstream, showcasing your taste for quirkiness.

Please note that these taste-reason pairs are based on the genres and themes of the movies you have rated highly, without using any time-related words or obscure terms.
