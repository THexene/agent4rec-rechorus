TASTE: Action-packed thrillers
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like Die Hard 2, Lethal Weapon 3, and The Hunt for Red October, which are all action-packed thrillers with intense and exciting storylines.

TASTE: Historical dramas
REASON: I have enjoyed movies like The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Man in the Iron Mask, and The Mask of Zorro, which are all historical dramas set in different time periods. I appreciate the rich storytelling and the way these movies transport me to different eras.
