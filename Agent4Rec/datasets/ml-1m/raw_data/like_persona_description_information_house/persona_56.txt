TASTE: Action and Adventure
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like Jurassic Park, Tomorrow Never Dies, and Rumble in the Bronx, which are all action-packed and filled with thrilling adventures. These movies keep me on the edge of my seat with their intense action sequences and exciting storylines.

TASTE: Comedy and Romance
REASON: I have also enjoyed movies like Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!, When Harry Met Sally..., and The Princess Bride, which are a perfect blend of comedy and romance. These movies make me laugh out loud with their hilarious moments and also warm my heart with their heartfelt love stories.
