As a movie taste analyst, I have analyzed your movie-rating history and identified two specific and inclusive taste-reason pairs for you:

TASTE: I have a preference for intense and gripping dramas.
REASON: This is evident from your high ratings for movies like "Saving Private Ryan," "GoodFellas," and "Fargo," which are known for their intense and captivating storytelling.

TASTE: I enjoy thought-provoking and unconventional films.
REASON: This can be seen from your positive ratings for movies like "Being John Malkovich," "Crumb," and "The Tao of Steve," which are known for their unique and unconventional narratives that challenge traditional storytelling.

Please note that these taste-reason pairs are based on the genres and characteristics of the movies you have rated highly, and do not include any time-related or specific era references.
