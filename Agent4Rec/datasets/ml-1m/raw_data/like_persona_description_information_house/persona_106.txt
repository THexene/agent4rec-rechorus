TASTE: I have a preference for classic and timeless movies.
REASON: Many of the movies I have rated highly are from the 1980s and 1990s, which are considered classic and have stood the test of time. These movies have enduring appeal and continue to be enjoyed by audiences today.

TASTE: I enjoy a mix of drama and comedy movies.
REASON: My high ratings for movies like "Driving Miss Daisy," "Election," "Grosse Pointe Blank," and "As Good As It Gets" indicate that I appreciate both dramatic and comedic elements in films. I find movies that blend these genres to be particularly engaging and enjoyable.
