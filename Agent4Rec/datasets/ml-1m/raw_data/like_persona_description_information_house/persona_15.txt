TASTE: Action-packed and thrilling
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like Die Hard: With a Vengeance, Air Force One, and Lethal Weapon 3, which are known for their intense action sequences and thrilling plotlines. These movies keep me on the edge of my seat with their high-octane action and adrenaline-pumping moments.

TASTE: Sci-fi and adventure
REASON: I have enjoyed movies such as The Fifth Element, Star Trek: First Contact, and The Rocketeer, which are set in futuristic or otherworldly settings and involve exciting adventures. These movies transport me to imaginative worlds and captivate me with their blend of science fiction and thrilling escapades.
