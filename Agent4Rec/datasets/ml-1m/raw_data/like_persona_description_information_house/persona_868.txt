TASTE: Action and Adventure
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like Mad Max 2, Die Hard, Escape from New York, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, which are all action-packed and thrilling. These movies feature intense chase scenes, daring stunts, and heroic protagonists, which I thoroughly enjoy.

TASTE: Sci-Fi and Fantasy
REASON: I am a big fan of movies like Blade Runner, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, and Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan. These films transport me to imaginative worlds filled with futuristic technology, epic battles, and fascinating creatures. The blend of science fiction and fantasy elements in these movies captivates my imagination.
