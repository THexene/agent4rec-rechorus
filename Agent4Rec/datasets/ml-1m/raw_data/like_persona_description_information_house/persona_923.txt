TASTE: I have a preference for a mix of genres, ranging from comedy to action to drama.
REASON: My movie rating history includes a variety of movies such as "There's Something About Mary" (comedy), "Pulp Fiction" (crime drama), "Aliens" (sci-fi action), "Remains of the Day" (period drama), and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (sci-fi action). This indicates that I enjoy movies from different genres.

TASTE: I appreciate movies that offer a blend of humor and suspense.
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like "Swingers" (comedy-drama), "Short Cuts" (drama-comedy), "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" (comedy-spy), "Face/Off" (action-thriller), and "The Usual Suspects" (crime mystery). These movies combine elements of humor and suspense, which I find appealing.
