TASTE: I have a preference for drama and historical movies.
REASON: Many of the movies I have rated highly, such as "Schindler's List," "The Shawshank Redemption," and "Boat, The (Das Boot)," fall into the drama genre and have historical settings. I enjoy the emotional depth and the storytelling in these types of movies.

TASTE: I also enjoy movies with a touch of comedy and satire.
REASON: Movies like "Wag the Dog," "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery," and "Best in Show" have elements of comedy and satire, which I find entertaining. I appreciate the clever humor and the way these movies poke fun at various aspects of society.
