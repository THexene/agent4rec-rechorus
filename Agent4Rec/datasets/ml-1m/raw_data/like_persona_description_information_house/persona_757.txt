TASTE: I have a preference for classic and timeless movies.
REASON: The movies I have rated highly, such as "Hamlet" (1996), "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (1961), and "Arsenic and Old Lace" (1944), are all considered classics in the film industry. These movies have stood the test of time and continue to be beloved by audiences.

TASTE: I enjoy movies with strong female leads and empowering storylines.
REASON: Movies like "Joy Luck Club, The" (1993), "Elizabeth" (1998), and "Mansfield Park" (1999) feature strong female characters who navigate complex situations and overcome challenges. These movies showcase the strength and resilience of women, which resonates with me.
