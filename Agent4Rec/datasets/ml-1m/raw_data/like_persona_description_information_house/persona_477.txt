TASTE: I have a preference for classic and iconic movies.
REASON: I enjoy movies like "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" (1977), "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (1975), and "Lolita" (1962) which are considered classics and have stood the test of time.

TASTE: I have a fondness for science fiction and fantasy films.
REASON: Movies like "Matrix, The" (1999), "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" (1991), and "Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan" (1982) fall into the science fiction genre, and I enjoy the imaginative and futuristic elements they bring to the screen.
