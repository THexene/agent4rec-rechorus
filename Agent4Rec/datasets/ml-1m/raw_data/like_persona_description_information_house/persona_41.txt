As a movie taste analyst, I have analyzed your movie-rating history and identified two specific and most inclusive taste-reason pairs for you:

TASTE: Action-packed and thrilling
REASON: You have given high ratings to movies like Jurassic Park, Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, and Lethal Weapon, which are known for their intense action sequences and thrilling plotlines.

TASTE: Epic and historical
REASON: Your high ratings for movies such as Braveheart, Glory, and The Fugitive suggest a preference for films that are set in historical contexts and depict grand, epic narratives.

Please note that these taste-reason pairs are based on the genres and themes of the movies you have rated highly, without using any time-related words or obscure terms.
