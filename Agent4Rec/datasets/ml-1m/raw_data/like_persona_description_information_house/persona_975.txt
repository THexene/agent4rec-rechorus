TASTE: I have a preference for romantic dramas and period films.
REASON: Many of the movies I have rated highly, such as "End of the Affair," "Washington Square," and "Age of Innocence," are romantic dramas set in different time periods. I enjoy the emotional depth and historical context that these films provide.

TASTE: I also enjoy a mix of comedy and adventure films.
REASON: Movies like "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," "Ghostbusters," and "Big" showcase my appreciation for light-hearted and entertaining films. I enjoy the humor and the sense of adventure that these movies offer.
