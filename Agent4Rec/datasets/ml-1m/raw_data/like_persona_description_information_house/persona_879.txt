TASTE: I have a preference for classic and timeless movies.
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like Gone with the Wind (1939), White Christmas (1954), and Fantasia (1940), which are considered classics and have stood the test of time.

TASTE: I enjoy a mix of animated and live-action films.
REASON: I have rated highly movies like Toy Story (1995), Aladdin (1992), Beauty and the Beast (1991), and The Lion King (1994), which are animated films, as well as live-action movies like Babe (1995) and Raising Arizona (1987). This shows my appreciation for both genres.
