REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like "Casablanca" (1942), "To Kill a Mockingbird" (1962), and "The Godfather: Part II" (1974), which are all set in different time periods and have a strong historical or classic feel to them.

TASTE: I enjoy emotionally powerful and thought-provoking dramas.
REASON: Movies like "Schindler's List" (1993), "The English Patient" (1996), and "A Cry in the Dark" (1988) have received high ratings from me. These movies tackle deep and emotional themes, leaving a lasting impact on the audience.
