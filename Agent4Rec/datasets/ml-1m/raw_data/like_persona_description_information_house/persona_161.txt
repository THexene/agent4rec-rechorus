As a movie taste analyst, I have analyzed your movie-rating history and identified two specific and inclusive taste-reason pairs for you:

TASTE: I enjoy thrilling and suspenseful movies.
REASON: I gave high ratings to movies like "Dead Calm" and "Night of the Living Dead" because I appreciate the excitement and suspense that these movies offer.

TASTE: I have a fondness for comedic and light-hearted movies.
REASON: I rated movies such as "Kingpin," "Weird Science," and "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" highly because I enjoy the humor and comedic elements present in these films.

Please note that these taste-reason pairs are based on the genres and themes of the movies you have rated highly.
