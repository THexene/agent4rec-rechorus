TASTE: I have a preference for light-hearted and comedic movies.
REASON: This is evident from my high ratings for movies like "Mrs. Doubtfire," "Romy and Michele's High School Reunion," and "While You Were Sleeping," which are known for their humor and feel-good nature.

TASTE: I enjoy movies with strong female leads.
REASON: This can be seen from my positive ratings for movies like "Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit," "My Best Friend's Wedding," and "Double Jeopardy," which feature strong and independent female characters as central figures.
