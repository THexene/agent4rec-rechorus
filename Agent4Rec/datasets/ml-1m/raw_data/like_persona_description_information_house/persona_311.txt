TASTE: I have a preference for drama and character-driven movies.
REASON: Many of the movies I have rated highly, such as "Schindler's List," "The Fisher King," and "Boys Don't Cry," are known for their intense and emotional storytelling. These movies often delve deep into the lives and struggles of their characters, which is something I appreciate in a film.

TASTE: I enjoy movies with a mix of drama and comedy.
REASON: Movies like "Jerry Maguire," "Broadcast News," and "The Fisher King" combine elements of both drama and comedy. I appreciate the way these films can tackle serious themes while still providing moments of levity and humor. This balance between drama and comedy adds depth and complexity to the storytelling, making the movies more engaging for me.
