TASTE: Action and Thriller
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like Saving Private Ryan, Mission: Impossible 2, and Die Hard 2. These movies are known for their intense action sequences and thrilling plotlines, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

TASTE: Comedy and Romance
REASON: I have also given high ratings to movies like Sleepless in Seattle, Clueless, and L.A. Story. These movies are a perfect blend of comedy and romance, and I found them to be entertaining and heartwarming.
