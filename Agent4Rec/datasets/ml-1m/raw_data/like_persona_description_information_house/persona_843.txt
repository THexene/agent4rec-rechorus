As a movie taste analyst, I have analyzed your movie-rating history and identified two specific and most inclusive taste-reason pairs for you:

TASTE: I have a preference for thrilling and suspenseful movies.
REASON: I highly rated movies like "Killer, The (Die xue shuang xiong)" and "Mission: Impossible 2" which are known for their intense action sequences and gripping plotlines.

TASTE: I enjoy thought-provoking and mind-bending movies.
REASON: I gave high ratings to movies like "The Sixth Sense" and "The Talented Mr. Ripley" which are known for their intriguing storylines and unexpected twists that keep the audience engaged.

Please note that these taste-reason pairs are based on the genres and themes of the movies you have rated highly, and do not include any time-related or obscure words.
