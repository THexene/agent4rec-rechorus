TASTE: I have a preference for classic movies with a mix of action and drama.
REASON: I enjoy movies like "Casablanca," "Lawrence of Arabia," and "Sunset Blvd." which are considered classics and have a blend of action and drama. These movies have stood the test of time and continue to captivate audiences with their compelling stories.

TASTE: I also enjoy sci-fi and adventure movies with a touch of mystery.
REASON: Movies like "Blade Runner," "2001: A Space Odyssey," and "Gattaca" fall into this category. I am drawn to the futuristic settings, mind-bending concepts, and the sense of adventure and discovery that these movies offer. The element of mystery adds an extra layer of intrigue to the overall experience.
