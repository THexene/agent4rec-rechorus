TASTE: Action and Adventure
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like X-Men, U-571, Running Man, Under Siege, and Predator, which are all known for their thrilling action sequences and adventurous storylines.

TASTE: Sci-Fi and Fantasy
REASON: I have enjoyed movies such as The Arrival, Space Cowboys, Blade Runner, Star Wars, and Jurassic Park, which are all set in imaginative worlds and explore futuristic or fantastical concepts.
