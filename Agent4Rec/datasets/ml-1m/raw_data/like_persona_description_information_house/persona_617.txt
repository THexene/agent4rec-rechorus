TASTE: Action and Adventure
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like Fight Club, Braveheart, and The Avengers, which are known for their intense action sequences and thrilling adventures. I enjoy the adrenaline rush and the excitement that these movies bring.

TASTE: Comedy and Satire
REASON: I have also rated movies like Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Monty Python's Life of Brian, and The Big Lebowski highly. These movies are known for their humor, wit, and satirical elements. I appreciate the clever jokes and the ability of these movies to make me laugh.
