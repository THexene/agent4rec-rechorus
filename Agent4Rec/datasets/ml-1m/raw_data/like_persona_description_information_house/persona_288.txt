TASTE: I have a preference for classic movies with a touch of nostalgia.
REASON: This is evident from my high ratings for movies like "Great Muppet Caper" (1981), "Breakfast Club, The" (1985), and "Beetlejuice" (1988), which are all known for their iconic status and enduring popularity.

TASTE: I enjoy a mix of genres, ranging from comedy to thriller.
REASON: This can be seen from my positive ratings for movies like "Little Shop of Horrors" (1986), "When Harry Met Sally..." (1989), "Get Shorty" (1995), and "From Dusk Till Dawn" (1996), which offer a diverse range of storytelling styles and genres.
