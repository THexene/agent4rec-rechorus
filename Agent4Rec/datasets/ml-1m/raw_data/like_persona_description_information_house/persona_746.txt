TASTE: I have a preference for classic movies.
REASON: I have given high ratings to several movies from the 1950s and 1960s, such as "Rebel Without a Cause" (1955), "All About Eve" (1950), "12 Angry Men" (1957), "To Kill a Mockingbird" (1962), and "West Side Story" (1961). These movies are considered classics and showcase my inclination towards timeless storytelling.

TASTE: I enjoy a mix of drama and comedy.
REASON: My rating history includes movies like "Network" (1976), "Working Girl" (1988), "Terms of Endearment" (1983), "The Graduate" (1967), "The Truman Show" (1998), and "GoodFellas" (1990). These movies span different genres but all have elements of both drama and comedy, indicating my appreciation for films that blend these two genres.
