TASTE: Action-packed and thrilling
REASON: I have given high ratings to movies like Terminal Velocity, Broken Arrow, and Die Hard, which are known for their intense action sequences and thrilling plotlines. These movies keep me on the edge of my seat with their high-octane stunts and adrenaline-pumping moments.

TASTE: Epic and adventurous
REASON: I have rated movies like Braveheart, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi highly. These films take me on epic adventures, whether it's the historical battles in Braveheart, the archaeological quests in Indiana Jones, or the intergalactic battles in Star Wars. I enjoy the grand scale and excitement that these movies offer.
