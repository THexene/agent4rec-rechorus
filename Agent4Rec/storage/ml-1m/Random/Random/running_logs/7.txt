        Relevant context from user 7's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Little Mermaid, The (1989), Independence Day (ID4) (1996), Dumb & Dumber (1994), Yojimbo (1961), among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Little Mermaid, The (1989)', 'Independence Day (ID4) (1996)', 'Dumb & Dumber (1994)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 7, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I appreciate the effort put into recommending movies, but unfortunately, the selection provided did not align with my highly selective taste in films. While I did watch and rate one movie from the recommendations, the majority of the suggestions were not to my liking. Additionally, the system did not accurately capture my preferences for classic, thought-provoking dramas, coming-of-age stories, intense and suspenseful films, and well-crafted critically acclaimed movies. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer with an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer trait, I value quality over quantity when it comes to movie choices. Therefore, I found the lack of tailored recommendations disappointing, leading me to exit the system after only one page of browsing.
