I dislike the rest movies: ['Home Fries (1998)', 'Air Bud: Golden Receiver (1998)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I disliked and did not take into account my ratings and preferences.
        Act as user 6, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.

It failed to consider my preferences and past ratings, resulting in a frustrating experience. As an Occasional Viewer with specific movie preferences, I found the lack of personalization disappointing. Additionally, the system did not cater to my diverse and avant-garde movie choices, further contributing to my dissatisfaction. Overall, the recommender system fell short in providing relevant and tailored recommendations, leading me to rate it a 3 out of 10.
