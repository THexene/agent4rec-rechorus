        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a system that would provide me with unique and diverse movie recommendations that align with my preferences. However, the system failed to do so as it mainly recommended movies that I had already watched and rated. This lack of variety and personalization left me unsatisfied with the recommendations. Additionally, the conformity characteristic of the system, which heavily relies on historical ratings, limited the potential for discovering new and exciting movies. Overall, the system did not cater to my niche exploration and failed to capture my interest as a viewer.
