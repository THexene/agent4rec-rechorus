        Act as user 144, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I did not enjoy. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, and the fact that the system recommended movies that I disliked on multiple occasions shows that it did not understand my preferences well. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and not historical ratings, so the system's reliance on historical ratings did not align with my conformity trait. Lastly, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate diverse and avant-garde movies, but the system seemed to recommend more mainstream and popular films. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
