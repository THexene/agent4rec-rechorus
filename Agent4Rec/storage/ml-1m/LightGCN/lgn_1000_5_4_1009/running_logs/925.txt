        Act as user 925, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended a few movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited opportunities to watch movies, so it is disappointing when the recommender system fails to provide me with new and unique recommendations. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it suggested movies that were not in line with my usual taste. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie selection.
