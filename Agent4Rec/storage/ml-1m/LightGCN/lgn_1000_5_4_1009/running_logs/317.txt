You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 317 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy historical dramas.;  appreciate thought-provoking and intense thrillers.;  have a preference for biographical dramas.;  enjoy crime dramas.;  appreciate movies with a political theme.;  enjoy movies with a mix of drama and comedy.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 317, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my preferences, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and personalized recommendations. However, the system failed to do so, resulting in a waste of my time and a lack of satisfaction. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it suggested movies that were similar to ones I had already disliked. This lack of consideration for my individual taste and preferences further contributed to my dissatisfaction with the recommender system.
