        Act as user 884, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system has provided me with some good movie recommendations that align with my taste, such as "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," "Saving Private Ryan," and "The Matrix." I appreciate that it takes into account my preference for action-packed, classic, sci-fi, and thought-provoking movies. However, I am not completely satisfied with the system because it recommended movies that I had already expressed dislike for, such as "Godfather: Part II" and "Amadeus." I would have expected the system to remember my preferences and avoid suggesting movies that I have already indicated a dislike for. Additionally, I would have liked to see more diverse and avant-garde movie recommendations, as I am a Cinematic Trailblazer who enjoys exploring unique and obscure films. Overall, while the recommender system has its strengths, there is room for improvement in terms of personalization and diversity of recommendations.
