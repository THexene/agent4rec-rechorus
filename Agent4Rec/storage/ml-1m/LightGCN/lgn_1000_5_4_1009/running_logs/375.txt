I appreciated that it suggested movies like "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" and "Lawrence of Arabia" which I enjoyed watching and rated highly. However, I was disappointed that the system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which made me feel like it wasn't paying attention to my preferences. Additionally, the system didn't offer me any new and unique movie choices that I hadn't already seen or heard of. Overall, while the system had some hits, it didn't fully meet my expectations, resulting in a rating of 6.
