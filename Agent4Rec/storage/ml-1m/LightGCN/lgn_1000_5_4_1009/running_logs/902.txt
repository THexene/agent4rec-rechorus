        Act as user 902, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the occasional movie recommendations that align with my taste, the majority of the movies recommended to me did not meet my preferences. I am an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, and the system failed to consistently provide me with movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. This lack of personalization and attention to my preferences greatly affected my satisfaction with the system.
