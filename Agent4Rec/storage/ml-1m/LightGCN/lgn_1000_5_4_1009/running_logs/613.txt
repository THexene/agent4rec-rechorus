        Act as user 613, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend horror movies, it failed to align with my specific taste. The system recommended movies that I had already indicated disliking, and it did not take into account my preference for horror movies with supernatural elements, iconic villains, and a suspenseful atmosphere. Additionally, the system did not provide any variety or options that could potentially broaden my horizons. As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I expect a recommender system to understand my preferences better and provide more accurate recommendations.
