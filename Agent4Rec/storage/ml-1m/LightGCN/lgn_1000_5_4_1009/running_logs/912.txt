RATING: 4
REASON: I am not very satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. Additionally, I was not given the opportunity to rate some of the movies that were recommended to me. This lack of personalization and repetition of movies I had already seen and disliked made the experience less enjoyable.
