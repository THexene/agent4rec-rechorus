        Act as user 978, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and preferences. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, it also suggested movies that I clearly stated I disliked. This indicates that the system did not fully understand my preferences and failed to provide accurate recommendations. Additionally, the system only recommended a few movies that I actually watched and enjoyed, which further highlights its inability to cater to my selective viewing habits. Overall, the system did not meet my needs as a viewer, resulting in a low rating of 3.
