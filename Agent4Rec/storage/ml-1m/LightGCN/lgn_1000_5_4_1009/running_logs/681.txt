        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, and this system failed to capture my movie preferences accurately. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the recommendations did not align with my tastes. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones recommended, and the majority of the recommended movies were not to my liking. As a result, I felt unsatisfied with the system and decided to exit after browsing three pages. The system needs to improve its understanding of my niche movie preferences and provide more accurate recommendations to earn a higher rating from me.
