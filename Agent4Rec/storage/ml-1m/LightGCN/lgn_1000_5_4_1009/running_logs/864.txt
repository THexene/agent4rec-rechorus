RATING: 4
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 4 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I was curious to see if this system could align with my specific tastes. However, I found that the recommendations were not tailored enough to my preferences. The system recommended movies that I disliked multiple times, which was disappointing. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not seem to take that into account. I expected the recommendations to align more closely with the movies that have been highly rated by others. Overall, the lack of personalization and consideration for my specific taste and historical ratings left me unsatisfied with this recommender system.
