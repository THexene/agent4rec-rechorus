        Relevant context from user 432's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Amadeus (1984), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), Casablanca (1942), Schindler's List (1993), among them, I watched ['Amadeus (1984)', "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)"] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 432, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: Although I found the movie recommendations to be aligned with my classic movie and drama preferences, the overall experience was not satisfying. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and rarely watch movies. The recommender system failed to capture my interest beyond a couple of movies. Additionally, as a dedicated follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not provide enough information about the ratings of the recommended movies. Lastly, as an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I expect a higher level of curation and exclusivity in the recommendations, which was lacking in this system. Overall, while the recommendations were somewhat in line with my preferences, the lack of personalization and limited options left me unsatisfied.
