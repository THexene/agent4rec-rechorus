I dislike the rest movies: ['Saving Private Ryan (1998)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 791, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie-watching habits and preferences. However, the recommender system failed to understand my unique taste and instead suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of diversity in its recommendations and a failure to consider my previous ratings. Additionally, the system did not provide any new or obscure movie options that align with my Cinematic Trailblazer trait. Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system's performance and its inability to cater to my specific movie preferences.
