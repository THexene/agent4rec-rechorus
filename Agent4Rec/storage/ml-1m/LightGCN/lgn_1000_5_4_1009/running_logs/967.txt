        Act as user 967, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, and I have a preference for movies that strictly align with my taste. The system failed to consistently provide me with movies that I enjoyed, which led to my dissatisfaction. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I curate my movie choices meticulously, and the system did not meet my expectations in terms of matching my preferences. Therefore, I cannot rate this recommender system higher than a 4.
