        Relevant context from user 609's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Jurassic Park, among them, I watched ['E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial', 'Jurassic Park'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Godfather, The (1972), Godfather: Part II, The (1974), American Beauty (1999), Schindler's List (1993), among them, I watched ['Godfather, The (1972)', 'Godfather: Part II, The (1974)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['American Beauty (1999)', "Schindler's List (1993)"].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not provide any new movies that I had not already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 609, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with any new movie recommendations that I had not already watched. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and rarely find movies that capture my interest. However, this recommender system only suggested movies that I had already seen and disliked. It did not offer any unique or obscure films that align with my cinematic trailblazer trait. Additionally, the system heavily relies on historical ratings, which limits the diversity of movie choices and does not cater to my preference for action-packed, classic, fantasy, adventure, comedy, and heartwarming films. Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system's inability to offer me new and diverse movie options.
