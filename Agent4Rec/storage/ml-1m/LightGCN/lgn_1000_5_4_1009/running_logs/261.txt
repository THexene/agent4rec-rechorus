        Act as user 261, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the recommender system suggested movies that I disliked multiple times, even after I provided feedback by rating them low. This indicates that the system did not effectively learn from my preferences. Additionally, the system only recommended a few movies that I actually watched and enjoyed, which is not satisfactory. As a result, I decided to leave the recommendation system after browsing just three pages.
