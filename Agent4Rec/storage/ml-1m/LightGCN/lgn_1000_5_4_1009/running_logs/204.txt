RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the diversity of movie recommendations, the system failed to align with my specific movie tastes. I am an occasional viewer who is only interested in movies that strictly align with my taste, and I tend to exit the system if I have a few unsatisfied memories. The system recommended movies that I disliked on multiple occasions, which indicates a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and ignore historical ratings. However, the system seems to heavily rely on historical ratings, which results in recommendations that do not resonate with me. Overall, the system needs to improve its understanding of my preferences and provide more tailored recommendations.
