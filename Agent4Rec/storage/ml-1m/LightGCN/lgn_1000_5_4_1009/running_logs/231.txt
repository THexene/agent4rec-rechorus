        Act as user 231, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide me with satisfactory recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. I enjoy suspenseful thrillers, classic films, romantic comedies, psychological dramas, and thought-provoking and artistic films. However, the recommender system did not seem to understand my preferences and kept suggesting movies that I did not enjoy.

Furthermore, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. I expect the recommender system to take this into account and provide me with movies that have high historical ratings. However, the system failed to do so and recommended movies that did not align with my taste or have high historical ratings.

Lastly, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have a very selective approach to watching movies. I curate my movie choices meticulously to match my personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety. Unfortunately, the recommender system did not understand this and kept suggesting movies that I had no interest in watching.

Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide me with satisfactory recommendations. Therefore, I rate it a 3.
