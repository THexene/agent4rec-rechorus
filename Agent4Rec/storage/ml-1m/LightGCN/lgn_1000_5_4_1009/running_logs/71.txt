You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as a user exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  have a preference for romantic comedies and feel-good movies.;  appreciate thought-provoking dramas and emotionally impactful films.;  enjoy classic and iconic films.;  have a liking for comedy films with a touch of quirkiness.;  have a preference for feel-good and light-hearted movies.. 
And your rating tendency is  I tend to give high ratings to romantic comedies, thought-provoking dramas, classic films, and feel-good movies.
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 71, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: Although the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Edward Scissorhands" and "Groundhog Day," there were also several movies that I disliked, such as "Boogie Nights" and "Shakespeare in Love." This inconsistency in the recommendations made me feel unsatisfied with the system. Additionally, the system failed to provide me with a wide variety of movie options, which is something I value as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer. Overall, while the system had some hits, it also had some misses, leading to a mediocre rating of 4.
