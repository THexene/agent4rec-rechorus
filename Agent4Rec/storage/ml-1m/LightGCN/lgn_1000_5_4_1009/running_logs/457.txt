- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 457, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, and this system failed to capture my movie preferences accurately. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the recommendations provided did not align with my tastes. I appreciate psychological thrillers, crime dramas, historical dramas, dark comedies, movies with a touch of mystery, and coming-of-age stories. However, most of the recommended movies did not fall into these genres. Additionally, the frequency of my movie-watching habits is extraordinarily infrequent, and this system did not account for that. As a result, I felt unsatisfied with the recommendations and decided to exit the system after browsing just three pages.
