I dislike the rest movies: ['Titanic (1997)', 'Jerry Maguire (1996)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 668, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and rarely watch movies. However, the recommender system suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my preferences and a failure to provide me with new and unique movie options. Additionally, the system heavily relies on historical ratings, which limits the diversity of movie choices and does not cater to my preference for quirky and unique films. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and did not find any value in using this system.
