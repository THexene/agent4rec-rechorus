        Act as user 287, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate that it recommended movies that align with my preferred genres, the system failed to consider my previous dislikes. It recommended movies that I had already expressed disinterest in on multiple pages, which shows a lack of personalization. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and tailored recommendations. Unfortunately, this system did not meet my expectations and did not effectively utilize my ratings and preferences to improve its recommendations.
