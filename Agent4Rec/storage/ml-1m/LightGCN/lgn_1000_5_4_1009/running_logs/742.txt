 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system had some hits and misses for me. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Creepshow" and "The Shining," it also suggested movies that I didn't enjoy, like "Phantasm" and "Blair Witch Project." I appreciate that the system took into account my personal preferences and historical ratings, but it didn't consistently provide recommendations that satisfied my niche interests. Additionally, as an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and accurate selection of movies that would truly capture my attention. Overall, the recommender system had its moments, but it didn't fully meet my expectations.
