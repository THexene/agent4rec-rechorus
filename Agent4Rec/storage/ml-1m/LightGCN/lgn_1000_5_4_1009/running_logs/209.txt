        Relevant context from user 209's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Godfather: Part II, The (1974), Annie Hall (1977), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), among them, I watched ['Godfather: Part II, The (1974)', 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Annie Hall (1977)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Silence of the Lambs, The (1991), Amadeus (1984), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Rear Window (1954), among them, I watched ['Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Amadeus (1984)', 'Rear Window (1954)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them to me.
        Act as user 209, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, it also recommended movies that I had already indicated I did not enjoy. This lack of personalization and consideration for my dislikes left me unsatisfied with the overall experience. Additionally, as a Balanced Evaluator, I value the opinions of others and historical ratings, but I also expect the system to consider my personal preferences. In this case, the system seemed to prioritize historical ratings over my individual taste, resulting in recommendations that did not fully align with my preferences. Overall, the system could benefit from better understanding and incorporating my personal preferences and dislikes to provide more tailored recommendations.
