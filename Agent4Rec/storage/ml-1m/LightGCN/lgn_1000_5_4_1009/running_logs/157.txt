        Act as user 157, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 4 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the recommender system suggested movies that I disliked multiple times, even after I provided feedback by rating them low. This indicates that the system did not effectively learn from my preferences and adjust its recommendations accordingly. Additionally, the system did not provide any new recommendations based on my preferred genres, which made the browsing experience repetitive and uninteresting. As a result, I felt unsatisfied and decided to leave the recommendation system after browsing only 4 pages.
