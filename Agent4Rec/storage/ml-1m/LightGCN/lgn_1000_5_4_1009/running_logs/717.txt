RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system had some hits and misses. I appreciated that it recommended movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Shawshank Redemption" and "American Beauty," which I enjoyed and rated highly.

Overall, while it did recommend some movies I liked, the system could have been more accurate and diverse in its suggestions.
