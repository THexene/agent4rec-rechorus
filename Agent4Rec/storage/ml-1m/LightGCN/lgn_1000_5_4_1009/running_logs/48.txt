        Act as user 48, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, it also suggested movies that I disliked. Additionally, the system did not seem to learn from my previous ratings and provide new recommendations based on them. As an occasional viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, so it is important for the system to accurately understand my taste and provide relevant suggestions. However, this system failed to consistently meet my expectations, resulting in a lower rating.
