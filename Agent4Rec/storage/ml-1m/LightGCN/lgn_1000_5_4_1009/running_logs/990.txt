        Relevant context from user 990's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Forbidden Planet (1956), Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983), Mad Max (1979), Day the Earth Stood Still, The (1951), among them, I watched ['Forbidden Planet (1956)', 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Robocop (1987), Westworld (1973), Dune (1984), Time Bandits (1981), among them, I watched ['Robocop (1987)', 'Westworld (1973)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Dune (1984)', 'Time Bandits (1981)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I have already watched and rated the movies recommended to me on both page 1 and page 2.
        Act as user 990, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with new and diverse movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes in movies, particularly enjoying science fiction, dystopian themes, time travel, action, and suspense. However, the system only recommended movies that I had already watched and rated on both page 1 and page 2. This lack of variety and failure to introduce me to new movies that align with my preferences left me unsatisfied. I was hoping for a more diverse selection that would surprise and engage me, but unfortunately, this recommender system fell short.
