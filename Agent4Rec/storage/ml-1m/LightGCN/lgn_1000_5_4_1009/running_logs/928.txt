        Act as user 928, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am highly unsatisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my diverse movie tastes and occasional movie-watching habits, the majority of the recommended movies did not align with my preferences. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones I watched, and the rest were not appealing to me. The system failed to understand my unique and eclectic taste in movies, and it did not provide enough variety in its recommendations. Additionally, the conformity aspect of the system seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings, which did not always match my personal preferences. Overall, this recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not successfully cater to my cinematic trailblazing nature.
