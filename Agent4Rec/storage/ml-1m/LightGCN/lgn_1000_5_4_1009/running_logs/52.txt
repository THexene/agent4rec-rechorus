        Act as user 52, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: Although the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan" and "Terminator," it failed to provide any new movie recommendations after the first two pages. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a wider range of options that would cater to my diverse taste in movies. Additionally, the system kept suggesting movies that I had already watched and rated, which was quite disappointing. Overall, while the initial recommendations were satisfactory, the lack of variety and repetition of suggestions left me unsatisfied.
