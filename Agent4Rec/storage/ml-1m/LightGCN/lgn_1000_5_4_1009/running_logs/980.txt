You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 980 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Occasional Viewer, seldom attracted by movie recommendations. Only curious about watching movies that strictly align the taste. The movie-watching habits are not very infrequent. And you tend to exit the recommender system if you have a few unsatisfied memories.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Maverick Critic who completely ignores historical ratings and evaluates movies solely based on own taste. Usually give ratings that are a lot different from historical ratings.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  Sci-Fi Fanatic;  Horror Enthusiast;  Classic Movie Lover;  Cult Film Aficionado;  Fantasy Admirer;  Action Junkie. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 980, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the effort in recommending movies based on my specific tastes, the system failed to consistently provide me with movies that aligned with my preferences. I disliked the majority of the recommended movies and found that the system did not understand my unique taste as an Occasional Viewer with a Maverick Critic and Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer traits. The recommendations did not cater to my specific genres of interest, such as Sci-Fi, Horror, Classic, Cult, Fantasy, and Action. Additionally, the system did not take into account my aversion to movies that do not align with my taste, as evidenced by my decision to exit the recommender system after browsing just four pages. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
