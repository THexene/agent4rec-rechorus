        Act as user 91, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer and the system failed to understand my movie-watching habits. The recommendations were not tailored to my preferences, as it suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it consistently recommended movies within the same genres. As a result, I did not feel satisfied with the system and decided to exit after browsing only 4 pages.
