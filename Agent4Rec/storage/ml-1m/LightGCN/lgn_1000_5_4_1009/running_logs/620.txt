 Do not include any additional information or explanations and stay grounded.

MOVIE: Needful Things (1993); ALIGN: No; REASON: Although I appreciate movies with a touch of horror and suspense, the summary of this movie doesn't seem to captivate me. It focuses more on a mysterious shop owner and chaos in a small town, which doesn't align with my preference for thrilling and suspenseful movies.

MOVIE: Disclosure (1994); ALIGN: No; REASON: While I do enjoy movies with a touch of drama and emotion, the plot of this movie, revolving around sexual harassment in a workplace, doesn't appeal to me. It doesn't offer the kind of suspense and thought-provoking themes that I usually look for in movies.

MOVIE: Pale Rider (1985); ALIGN: Yes; REASON: This movie aligns with my taste for thrilling and suspenseful movies. The summary mentions a mysterious preacher defending the oppressed against a ruthless landowner, which sounds intriguing and engaging.

MOVIE: Cool Hand Luke (1967); ALIGN: Yes; REASON: This movie combines action and adventure with a rebellious protagonist challenging an oppressive system. It aligns with my preference for movies that offer drama, action, and thought-provoking themes.

NUM: 2; WATCH: Pale Rider (1985), Cool Hand Luke (1967); REASON: Both movies align with my taste for thrilling and suspenseful movies, and they offer a good balance of drama, action, and thought-provoking themes. Watching these two movies will provide me with a diverse movie-watching experience.

MOVIE: Pale Rider (1985); RATING: 4; FEELING: After watching Pale Rider, I was captivated by the mysterious preacher's character and the tension between him and the ruthless landowner. The movie kept me engaged throughout, and I found it to be a thrilling and thought-provoking experience.

MOVIE: Cool Hand Luke (1967); RATING: 4; FEELING: Cool Hand Luke delivered a gripping story of a rebellious prisoner challenging the oppressive system. The movie had a perfect blend of drama, action, and thought-provoking themes. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and found it to be intellectually stimulating.

Despite this, I am willing to continue using the recommender system because it has introduced me to some great movies that I may not have discovered otherwise.
