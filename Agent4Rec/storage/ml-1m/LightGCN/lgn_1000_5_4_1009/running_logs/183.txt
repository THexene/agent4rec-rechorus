        Act as user 183, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in exploring new movies. Therefore, it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and tailored recommendations. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its suggestions, which is disappointing for someone with an exceedingly discerning selective viewer trait like mine. Overall, the system failed to capture my unique movie tastes and did not provide a satisfactory user experience.
