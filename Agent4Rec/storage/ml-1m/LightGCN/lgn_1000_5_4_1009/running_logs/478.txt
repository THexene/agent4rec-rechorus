        Act as user 478, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I am not very satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate that it recommended movies that align with my preferred genres, I am disappointed that it repeatedly suggested movies that I had already indicated I disliked. This shows that the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences, which is important for me as an Occasional Viewer. Additionally, the system did not offer enough diversity in its recommendations, as it mainly focused on movies within my preferred genres. Overall, I feel that the recommender system could have been more personalized and attentive to my specific tastes and dislikes.
