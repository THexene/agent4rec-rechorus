 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations as an occasional viewer with specific movie tastes. While it recommended some movies that aligned with my preferences, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows that the system did not take into account my previous interactions and preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it consistently suggested movies from the same genres. As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I expect a recommender system to understand my preferences and provide more diverse and tailored recommendations.
