RATING: 7
REASON: The recommender system has been quite satisfactory in providing me with a variety of movie recommendations. I appreciate the fact that it has introduced me to some classic films that I may not have discovered on my own. The system's ability to recommend movies with strong female leads and a touch of romance aligns well with my preferences. However, there have been instances where the system recommended movies that I did not enjoy, which is why I cannot give it a higher rating. Nonetheless, I am still willing to continue using the recommender system as it has introduced me to some great films.
