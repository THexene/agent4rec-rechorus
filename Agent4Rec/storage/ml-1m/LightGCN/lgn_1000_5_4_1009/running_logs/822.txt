        Act as user 822, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, the recommender system failed to take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits and suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences left me unsatisfied with the recommendations. Additionally, the system did not offer enough diversity in its suggestions, as it mainly recommended movies from the same genres that I typically enjoy. Overall, the system did not provide me with any new or exciting movie options, resulting in a low rating of 3.
