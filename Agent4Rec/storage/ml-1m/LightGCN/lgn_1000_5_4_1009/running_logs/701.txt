        Relevant context from user 701's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Matrix, The, American Beauty, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, among them, I watched ['Terminator 2: Judgment Day', 'Matrix, The'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['American Beauty'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, Forrest Gump, Jurassic Park, Sixth Sense, The, among them, I watched ['Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back', 'Forrest Gump', 'Jurassic Park'] and rate them ['4', '5', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Sixth Sense, The'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 701, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the occasional movie recommendations, the system failed to provide me with new and diverse movie options. It recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I expect the recommender system to offer me a wider range of options that align with my taste for thrilling, suspenseful, action-packed, adventurous, comedic, light-hearted, and visually stunning movies. The system's inability to suggest movies that I haven't seen or disliked greatly diminishes its usefulness to me.
