I dislike the rest movies: ['Total Recall (1990)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations.

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to provide me with any new recommendations after just two pages. It recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer any variety or diversity in its suggestions, sticking to the same genres and not exploring different options. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations as an elusive occasional viewer, and I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations it provided.
