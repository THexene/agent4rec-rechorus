        Act as user 882, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste, which includes action-packed thrillers, historical dramas, psychological thrillers, classic dramas, and crime dramas. However, the recommender system recommended movies that did not match my preferences, such as comedies like "Shanghai Noon" and sci-fi films like "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi". 

Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. However, the recommender system did not take this into account and recommended movies that I did not enjoy. This suggests that the system did not effectively consider my conformity trait.

Furthermore, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate unique and obscure movies. However, the recommender system did not provide me with any recommendations that aligned with this trait. It only suggested popular and well-known films like "Pulp Fiction" and "Blade Runner".

Overall, the recommender system failed to meet my expectations and did not provide accurate recommendations based on my movie preferences and traits. Therefore, I rate it a 3.
