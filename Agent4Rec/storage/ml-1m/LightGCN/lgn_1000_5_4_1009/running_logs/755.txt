The system did not seem to understand my preference for movies with a dark and mysterious atmosphere, unique and unconventional storylines, classic and cult movies, humor and wit, exploration of the human psyche and emotions, and fantasy and supernatural elements. Additionally, the system did not take into account my occasional exploration of different genres. Overall, the recommendations did not meet my expectations, and I was disappointed with the lack of alignment between my preferences and the suggested movies.
