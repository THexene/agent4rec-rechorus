        Relevant context from user 546's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: English Patient, The (1996), All About My Mother (Todo Sobre Mi Madre) (1999), Joy Luck Club, The (1993), Elizabeth (1998), among them, I watched ['English Patient, The (1996)', 'Joy Luck Club, The (1993)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively.

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Sense and Sensibility (1995), Jerry Maguire (1996), Ever After: A Cinderella Story (1998), A Walk on the Moon (1999), among them, I watched ['Sense and Sensibility (1995)', 'Ever After: A Cinderella Story (1998)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Ever After: A Cinderella Story (1998)', 'Jerry Maguire (1996)', 'A Walk on the Moon (1999)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 546, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because I am extremely unsatisfied with the recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, the recommender system failed to understand my unique taste and recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my movie-watching habits and a disregard for my previous ratings. Additionally, the system did not offer any variety or diversity in its recommendations, which is disappointing as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide relevant and satisfying recommendations.
