REASON: The recommender system provided some movie recommendations that aligned with my taste, such as "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, there were also a few movies that I disliked, such as "Fifth Element, The" and "Batman Forever (1995)."

Overall, the recommender system was decent but could be improved to better cater to my specific movie preferences.
