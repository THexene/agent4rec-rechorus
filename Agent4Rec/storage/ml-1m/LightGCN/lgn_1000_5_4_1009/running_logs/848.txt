        Act as user 848, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to consistently recommend movies that aligned with my taste. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do decide to watch a movie, I expect the recommendations to be tailored to my preferences. However, in this case, the majority of the recommended movies did not appeal to me. I only enjoyed a few movies that I watched and rated, while disliking the rest. This lack of satisfaction led me to exit the recommender system after browsing just three pages. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
