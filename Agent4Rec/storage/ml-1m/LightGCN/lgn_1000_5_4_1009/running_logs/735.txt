 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that align with my specific tastes. However, the system recommended a lot of movies that I ended up disliking. Despite providing ratings that were different from historical ratings, the system still failed to accurately understand my preferences. Additionally, the diversity characteristic of being a Cinematic Trailblazer was not fully utilized, as the system did not recommend any unique or obscure movies that I might have enjoyed. Overall, the system did not provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience, leading me to exit the system after browsing just three pages.
