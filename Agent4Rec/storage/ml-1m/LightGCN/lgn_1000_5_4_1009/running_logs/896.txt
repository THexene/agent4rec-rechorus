        Act as user 896, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, and this system failed to provide me with movie recommendations that aligned with my tastes. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the system still recommended movies that I did not enjoy. The lack of variety in the recommendations also did not meet my expectations as an exceedingly discerning selective viewer. Additionally, the infrequency of my movie-watching habits makes it crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences, which it failed to do. Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommendations and would not rely on this system for future movie suggestions.
