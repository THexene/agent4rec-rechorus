 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: Although the recommender system initially provided me with some movies that aligned with my taste, it quickly fell short in providing further recommendations that satisfied my preferences. The system failed to take into account my dislikes and did not offer any new suggestions based on my previous ratings. As an occasional viewer with specific movie preferences, I expected the recommender system to better understand my taste and provide more accurate recommendations. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 4.
