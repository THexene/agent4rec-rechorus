        Act as user 365, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to provide me with recommendations that aligned with my tastes. The movies suggested to me were mostly ones that I had already watched and disliked. Additionally, the system did not take into account my diversity trait as a Cinematic Trailblazer, as it recommended mainstream movies that did not defy categorization. The system also did not consider my conformity trait as a Maverick Critic, as it relied heavily on historical ratings instead of evaluating movies solely based on my own taste. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not cater to my unique preferences.
