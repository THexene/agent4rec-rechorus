        Act as user 129, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to consistently recommend movies that aligned with my preferences. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies in line with my preferred genres, the majority of the movies suggested did not appeal to me. I found myself disliking most of the recommended movies and only enjoying a few. This lack of satisfaction with the recommendations made me lose interest in the system and ultimately led me to exit after browsing just four pages. The system's inability to consistently provide me with movies that I would enjoy greatly impacted my overall satisfaction with the recommender system.
