        Act as user 203, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: While I appreciate the effort of the recommender system in providing movie recommendations, I am not completely satisfied with the results. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which indicates that it did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer enough diversity in its recommendations, as it mainly suggested popular mainstream movies that did not align with my unique and avant-garde taste. Although I am a movie enthusiast and willing to watch nearly every movie recommended to me, the lack of consideration for my individual preferences and the repetition of movies I had already seen and disliked hindered my overall satisfaction with the recommender system.
