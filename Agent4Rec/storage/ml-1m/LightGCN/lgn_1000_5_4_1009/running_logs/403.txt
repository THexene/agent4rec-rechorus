        Relevant context from user 403's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Princess Bride, The, Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, Stand by Me, among them, I watched ['Princess Bride, The', 'Stand by Me'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ["Schindler's List"].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Silence of the Lambs, The, Shawshank Redemption, The, Godfather: Part II, The, Raiders of the Lost Ark, among them, I watched ['Silence of the Lambs, The', 'Shawshank Redemption, The'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Godfather: Part II, The', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I disliked some of the movies recommended to me and only enjoyed a few of them.
        Act as user 403, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Princess Bride, The" and "Stand by Me," it also suggested movies like "Schindler's List" which I did not enjoy. Additionally, the system recommended movies like "Silence of the Lambs, The" and "Shawshank Redemption, The" on the second page, which I did watch and rate positively. However, the system failed to understand my diverse and avant-garde taste in movies, as it did not recommend any movies that were Classic and Nostalgic, Intense and Thought-Provoking, or Heartwarming and Emotional. Overall, the recommendations were not tailored enough to my unique preferences, resulting in a low satisfaction rating.
