RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate that it recommended movies that align with my preferred genres, it failed to provide new recommendations after a few pages. It kept suggesting movies that I had already watched and disliked, which made me lose interest in continuing to explore the system. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it recommended movies that were not in line with my taste. Overall, the lack of variety and personalization in the recommendations led to my dissatisfaction with the system.
