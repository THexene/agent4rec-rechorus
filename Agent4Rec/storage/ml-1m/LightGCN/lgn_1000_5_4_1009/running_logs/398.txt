        Relevant context from user 398's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Back to the Future, Casablanca, Forrest Gump, among them, I watched ['E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial', 'Back to the Future'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively.

        Act as user 398, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 out of 10. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my tastes, such as "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" and "Back to the Future," the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. I appreciate the system taking into account both historical ratings and personal preferences, but it seemed to heavily favor popular and mainstream movies that I have already seen or have no interest in. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for more unique and obscure movie recommendations that would challenge and captivate me. Unfortunately, this system failed to deliver on that front. Additionally, the infrequency of my movie-watching habits makes it even more crucial for the recommender to provide highly tailored and enticing suggestions, which it did not do. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not understand or cater to my cinematic trailblazer nature.
