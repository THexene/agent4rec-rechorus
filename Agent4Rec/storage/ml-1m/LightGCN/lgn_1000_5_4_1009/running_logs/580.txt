        Relevant context from user 580's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Shakespeare in Love (1998), Groundhog Day (1993), Being John Malkovich (1999), Babe (1995), among them, I watched ['Shakespeare in Love (1998)', 'Groundhog Day (1993)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively.

I dislike the rest movies: ['Clueless (1995)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 580, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, the recommender system suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my movie-watching habits and preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer any variety or diversity in its recommendations, which is important to me as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with any new or appealing movie options.
