RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide accurate recommendations based on my preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do decide to explore them, I expect the system to align with my taste. However, the system repeatedly suggested movies that I disliked, resulting in a high number of unsatisfied memories. 

Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. Unfortunately, the recommender system did not take this into account and did not provide me with movies that align with the historical ratings I usually follow. 

Furthermore, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have a very specific taste in movies and prefer intense and thrilling films, thought-provoking and emotionally impactful movies, action-packed and adventurous films, as well as movies with a mix of drama and romance, and those with a social or political message. However, the recommender system did not cater to this level of selectivity and did not offer any variety or new recommendations based on my preferences.

Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations as an Occasional Viewer, a Dedicated Follower, and an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer. It failed to provide accurate recommendations based on my taste, did not consider my reliance on historical ratings, and did not offer any variety or new suggestions. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 3.
