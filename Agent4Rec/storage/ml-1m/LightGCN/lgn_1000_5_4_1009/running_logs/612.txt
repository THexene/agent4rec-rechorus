        Act as user 612, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate that it recommended movies based on my preferred genres, it failed to accurately understand my taste and preferences. The system repeatedly suggested movies that I disliked, and it did not provide any new recommendations that aligned with my interests. Additionally, the system did not take into account my ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that were not in line with my previous choices. As an occasional viewer, I rely on accurate recommendations to enhance my movie-watching experience, and this system did not meet my expectations.
