        Act as user 328, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 7; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 7. 

The reason for this rating is that the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Schindler's List", "Chicken Run", "Boogie Nights", and "Back to the Future". I enjoyed watching these movies and gave them positive ratings. 

However, there were also movies that were recommended to me that I did not enjoy, such as "Fargo", "Shakespeare in Love", "Annie Hall", "Saving Private Ryan", and "L.A. Confidential". These movies did not align with my tastes and I gave them negative ratings. 

Although the system did recommend some movies that I liked, the fact that it also recommended movies that I disliked makes me feel a little unsatisfied. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is important for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences. 

Overall, while the system did have some hits, it also had some misses, which is why I would rate it a 7.
