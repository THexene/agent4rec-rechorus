RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the recommendations it provided. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the majority of the movies recommended to me did not match my preferences. While I did enjoy a few movies, such as Airplane! and Boogie Nights, the rest of the recommendations were not to my liking. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. Unfortunately, the system did not take this into account and recommended movies that I did not enjoy. Lastly, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate diverse and thought-provoking films. However, the recommendations seemed to be more mainstream and did not cater to my preference for unconventional movies. Overall, I am not satisfied with the recommender system as it did not meet my expectations and did not provide recommendations that aligned with my taste.
