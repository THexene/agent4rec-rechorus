 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. The system recommended movies that I had already expressed dislike for on multiple pages, which indicates that it did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer any new or diverse movie recommendations that could potentially align with my taste. Therefore, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system and rate it a 3 out of 10.
