        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to satisfy my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the system recommended movies that I disliked on all three pages. This indicates that the system did not understand my preferences accurately. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. But the system did not take this into account and recommended movies that did not align with the historical ratings. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide accurate and satisfying recommendations.
