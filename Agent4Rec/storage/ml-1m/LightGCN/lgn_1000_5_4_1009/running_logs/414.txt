 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: Although the recommender system provided me with some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" and "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory," I was disappointed with the lack of diversity in the recommendations. The system repeatedly suggested movies that I had already watched and rated, which made me feel like it wasn't taking into account my previous interactions. Additionally, there were several movies in the recommendations that I disliked, such as "Dumbo" and "Mulan." As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I was hoping for more unique and obscure movie suggestions that would pique my interest. Overall, the recommender system fell short in satisfying my cinematic preferences and providing a diverse range of recommendations.
