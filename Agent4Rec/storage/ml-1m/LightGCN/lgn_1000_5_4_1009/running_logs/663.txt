I dislike the rest movies: ['Saving Private Ryan (1998)', 'Battlefield Earth (2000)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 663, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and rarely watch movies. However, this system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. It did not take into account my preference for action-packed, science fiction, suspenseful, mystery, and adventure movies. Additionally, the system did not offer any diversity in its recommendations, sticking to popular and well-known movies. As a maverick critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and not historical ratings, so the system's reliance on historical ratings did not align with my preferences. Overall, the system did not understand my unique movie-watching habits and failed to provide personalized and diverse recommendations.
