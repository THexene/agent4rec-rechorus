- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 917, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: Although the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, I found that it often recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This made me feel like the system wasn't taking into account my previous ratings and preferences. Additionally, the system didn't seem to offer much variety in terms of genres or movie types, which made it difficult for me to discover new movies that I might enjoy. Overall, I was left feeling unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system could have done a better job of understanding my preferences and offering more diverse options.
