        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to consistently align with my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the system recommended several movies that I disliked, such as "French Connection, The" and "Fargo" on page 1, "Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)" on page 2, and "Day the Earth Stood Still, The (1951)" on page 3. This indicates that the system did not effectively understand my preferences and failed to provide accurate recommendations. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in the recommended movies, as it repeatedly suggested movies from genres that I am not interested in. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
