        Relevant context from user 824's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: English Patient, The (1996), Sense and Sensibility (1995), Sliding Doors (1998), You've Got Mail (1998), among them, I watched ['English Patient, The (1996)', 'Sense and Sensibility (1995)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Sense and Sensibility (1995)', 'Sliding Doors (1998)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Bridges of Madison County, The (1995), Notting Hill (1999), Shine (1996), Emma (1996), among them, I watched ['Bridges of Madison County, The (1995)', 'Notting Hill (1999)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Notting Hill (1999)', 'Shine (1996)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 824, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific and selective tastes in movies. However, the recommender system did not take into account my preferences for romantic dramas, coming-of-age films, thought-provoking dramas, feel-good movies, period films, and fantasy and adventure movies. Instead, it recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my unique preferences and a failure to provide me with diverse and personalized recommendations. Additionally, the system did not consider my maverick critic trait, as it relied solely on historical ratings rather than evaluating movies based on my own taste. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with valuable recommendations, resulting in a low rating of 2.
