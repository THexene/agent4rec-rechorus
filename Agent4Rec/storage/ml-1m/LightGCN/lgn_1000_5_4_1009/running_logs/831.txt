Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.

        Act as user 831, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am highly unsatisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my diverse taste in movies, the system consistently recommended movies that I did not enjoy. The majority of the movies suggested were not aligned with my preferences, and I ended up disliking most of them. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences and suggest movies that I am likely to enjoy. However, this system failed to do so, resulting in a disappointing experience. Additionally, the conformity trait of the system, which heavily relies on historical ratings, did not align with my preference for unique and obscure films. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations, and I would not consider using it again in the future.
