        Relevant context from user 656's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Ghostbusters (1984), Boogie Nights (1997), American Beauty (1999), Exorcist, The (1973), among them, I watched ['Ghostbusters (1984)', 'American Beauty (1999)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively.

I dislike the rest movies: [].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them to me.
        Act as user 656, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and it is important for the recommender system to respect those preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it kept suggesting movies from the same genres that I had already watched and rated. The lack of consideration for my individual taste and the repetitive recommendations left me unsatisfied with the system.
