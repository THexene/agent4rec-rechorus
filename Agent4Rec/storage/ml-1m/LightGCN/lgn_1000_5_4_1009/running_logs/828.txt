        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.

Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As a result, I did not feel satisfied with the recommendations and decided to exit the system after browsing only three pages.
