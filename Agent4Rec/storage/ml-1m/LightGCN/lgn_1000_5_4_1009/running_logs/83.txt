You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 83 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: A Niche Explorer who occasionally explores different genres and mostly sticks to preferred movie types.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy sci-fi movies with a touch of adventure and action.;  appreciate classic and iconic movies.;  have a fondness for epic and thrilling movies.;  am not particularly interested in romantic or drama movies.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 83, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because I am extremely unsatisfied with the recommendations it provided. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and the system failed to understand and cater to them. Despite my clear indication of enjoying sci-fi movies with a touch of adventure and action, the system repeatedly recommended movies that did not align with my tastes, such as romantic and drama movies. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences greatly diminished my satisfaction with the system.
