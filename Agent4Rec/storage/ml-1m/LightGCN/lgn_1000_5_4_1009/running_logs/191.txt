        Act as user 191, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6; REASON: While I appreciate the effort of the recommender system in suggesting movies based on my preferences, I have to say that I am not completely satisfied with the results. Although I enjoyed and rated positively some of the recommended movies, there were also several movies that I disliked and did not watch. This indicates that the recommender system did not fully understand my movie tastes and preferences. Additionally, I was disappointed that I did not have the opportunity to explore more diverse and avant-garde movies, which is something I value as a Cinematic Trailblazer. Overall, the recommender system has room for improvement in accurately predicting my movie preferences and offering a wider range of movie choices. Hence, I rate it a 6.
