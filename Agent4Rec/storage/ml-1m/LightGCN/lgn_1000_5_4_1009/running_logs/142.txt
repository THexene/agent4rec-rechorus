        Act as user 142, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific and discerning tastes when it comes to movies. I appreciate intense and dramatic films, thought-provoking and critically acclaimed movies, as well as dark and suspenseful thrillers. However, the recommender system consistently recommended movies that did not align with my preferences. 

Furthermore, as a maverick critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and completely ignore historical ratings. Unfortunately, the recommender system seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings, resulting in recommendations that were not in line with my preferences. This lack of conformity to my taste made it difficult for me to trust the recommendations provided.

Additionally, as an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I have a curated selection of movies that I enjoy, leaving little room for variety. The recommender system failed to understand this aspect of my movie-watching habits and consistently recommended movies that I had no interest in.

Overall, the recommender system did not cater to my unique movie preferences and failed to provide me with satisfactory recommendations. Therefore, I rate it a 2.
