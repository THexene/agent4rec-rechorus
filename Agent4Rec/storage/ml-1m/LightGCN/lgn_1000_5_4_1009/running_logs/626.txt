You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 626 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Maverick Critic who completely ignores historical ratings and evaluates movies solely based on own taste. Usually give ratings that are a lot different from historical ratings.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy science fiction movies.;  appreciate classic movies.;  like action-packed movies.;  have a preference for adventure movies.;  enjoy comedic movies.;  have an interest in horror movies.;  appreciate movies with a unique and thought-provoking storyline.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings.

        Act as user 626, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am highly unsatisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, the system failed to accurately understand and cater to my preferences. It recommended a lot of movies that I disliked, and only a few that I enjoyed. Additionally, the system did not take into account my conformity trait as a maverick critic, as it solely relied on historical ratings rather than evaluating movies based on my own taste. Furthermore, the system did not offer any variety in its recommendations, which is disappointing as an exceedingly discerning selective viewer. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations.
