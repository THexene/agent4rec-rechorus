        Act as user 89, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: Although the recommender system did recommend some movies that I enjoyed, such as "Terminator" and "Princess Bride," it also recommended movies that I disliked, such as "Godfather" and "Schindler's List." This inconsistency in the recommendations made me feel unsatisfied with the system. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its recommendations, as it mostly suggested movies from genres that I already enjoy. Overall, I would rate this recommender system a 4 because it failed to consistently provide me with suitable movie recommendations and lacked diversity in its suggestions.
