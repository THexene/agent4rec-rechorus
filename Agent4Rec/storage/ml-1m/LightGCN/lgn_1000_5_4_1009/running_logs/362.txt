        Act as user 362, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the majority of the recommended movies did not match my preferences. I appreciate comedy, drama, animated, romance, historical/war, fantasy/science fiction, and movies with a mix of comedy and drama, as well as unique storytelling approaches. But the system failed to consistently recommend movies that fit these criteria. I found myself disliking most of the movies suggested to me, which led me to exit the recommender system after browsing just 4 pages. The system did not meet my expectations and did not effectively cater to my selective viewing habits. Therefore, I cannot rate it higher than a 3.
