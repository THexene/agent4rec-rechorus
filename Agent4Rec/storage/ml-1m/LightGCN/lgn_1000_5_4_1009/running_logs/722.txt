REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to accurately understand my movie preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and infrequent movie-watching habits. The system did not take into account my preference for classic movies with a touch of suspense and mystery, thought-provoking and intense dramas, dark comedies and satirical humor, and psychological thrillers and sci-fi action movies. Instead, it recommended movies like Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back and Godfather: Part II, which are not aligned with my preferences. Additionally, the system heavily relies on historical ratings, which does not allow for independent opinions. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the recommendations and decided to leave the system after browsing just two pages.
