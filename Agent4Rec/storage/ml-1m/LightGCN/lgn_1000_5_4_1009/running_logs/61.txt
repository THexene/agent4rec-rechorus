        Act as user 61, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 out of 10. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, there were also several movies that I disliked. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, which was disappointing. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and personalized recommendations. Unfortunately, this system fell short in meeting my expectations.
