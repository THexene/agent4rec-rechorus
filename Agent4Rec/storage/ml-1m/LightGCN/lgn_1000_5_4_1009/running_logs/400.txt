        Act as user 400, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to align with my taste and preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the majority of the recommended movies did not appeal to me. Despite watching a few movies and giving them ratings based on historical ratings, the system did not improve its recommendations. As an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I expect the recommender system to understand my preferences and provide me with movies that I would enjoy. Unfortunately, this system did not meet my expectations.
