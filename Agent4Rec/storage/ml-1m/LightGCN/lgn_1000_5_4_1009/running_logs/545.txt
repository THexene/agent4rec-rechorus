RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and True Lies, it also recommended movies that I disliked, like Total Recall and The Fugitive. This indicates that the system did not fully understand my preferences and failed to consistently provide recommendations that I would enjoy. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and dislikes when generating subsequent recommendations, which led to a repetitive and unsatisfying experience. Overall, the system needs improvement in understanding and catering to my specific movie preferences.
