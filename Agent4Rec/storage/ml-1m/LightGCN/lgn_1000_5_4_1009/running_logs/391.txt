        Act as user 391, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my preferences, the majority of the movies suggested were not to my liking. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences, and the system failed to consistently recommend movies that matched my interests. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences greatly impacted my satisfaction with the system.
