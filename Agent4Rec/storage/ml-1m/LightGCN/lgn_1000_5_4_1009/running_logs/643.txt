        Relevant context from user 643's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: American Beauty, Sixth Sense, The, Groundhog Day, Shakespeare in Love, among them, I watched ['American Beauty', 'Sixth Sense, The'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Shakespeare in Love'].

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did suggest a couple of movies that aligned with my taste, such as "American Beauty" and "The Sixth Sense," I was not satisfied with the overall recommendations. The system failed to understand my preference for thrilling and suspenseful movies, as it suggested movies like "Shakespeare in Love," which I did not enjoy. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it only suggested a few movies on the first page. Overall, I found the recommender system to be lacking in terms of understanding my preferences and providing a diverse range of options.
