 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 9
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 9 because it successfully recommended movies that aligned with my diverse movie tastes. Despite being an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, the system managed to suggest movies that I enjoyed and rated highly. It took into account both historical ratings and my personal preferences, resulting in a balanced evaluation of the movies. The system also considered my preference for sci-fi and fantasy, classic films, action and adventure, crime and drama, comedy, family-friendly, and movies with a mix of drama and romance or action. It even recommended some unique and obscure films that I may not have discovered on my own. The only reason I didn't rate it a perfect 10 is because there were a few movies that I didn't enjoy, but overall, I am very satisfied with the recommendations provided.
