        Act as user 811, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the system recommended a lot of movies that I did not enjoy, such as Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Repo Man, Network, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Bridge on the River Kwai, and Birds. These movies did not match my preference for romantic comedies, action-packed thrillers, dark and gritty dramas, classic and timeless films, and thought-provoking and artistic films. Despite watching a few movies that I liked, such as Chinatown, Godfather: Part II, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, GoodFellas, and Terminator, the overall recommendation experience was unsatisfactory. I expected the system to better understand my preferences and recommend movies that align with them. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 3.
