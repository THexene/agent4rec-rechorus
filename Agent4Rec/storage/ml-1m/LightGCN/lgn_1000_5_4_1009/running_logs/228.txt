        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.

RATING: 2
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, the system recommended movies that I disliked on both page 1 and page 2. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have high expectations for the few movies I choose to watch, and the system failed to meet those expectations. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not take that into account and recommended movies that did not align with my preferences. Overall, the system did not understand my unique movie tastes and did not provide accurate recommendations, leading to my dissatisfaction.
