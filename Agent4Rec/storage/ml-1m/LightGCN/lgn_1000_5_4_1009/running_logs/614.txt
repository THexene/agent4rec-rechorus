RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, it failed to provide new recommendations based on my preferences after a few pages. The system kept suggesting movies that I had already watched and disliked, which showed a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not take into account my activity trait of being an occasional viewer, as it did not provide enough variety in the recommendations. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not effectively cater to my specific movie tastes and viewing habits.
