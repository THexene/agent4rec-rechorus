        Relevant context from user 794's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Groundhog Day, Babe, Braveheart, Shawshank Redemption, among them, I watched ['Groundhog Day', 'Babe'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Braveheart'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Secret Garden, The, Forrest Gump, Aladdin, Sixth Sense, The, among them, I watched ['Secret Garden, The', 'Forrest Gump'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Sixth Sense, The'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately predict my preferences, as I disliked some of the recommended movies that I watched and rated.
        Act as user 794, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that I enjoyed, it also recommended movies that I did not like. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately predict my preferences. However, it failed to do so in this case. Additionally, as a balanced evaluator, I consider both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. The system did not seem to take this into account, as some of the recommended movies had ratings that did not align with my own. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendation result and would have appreciated a more accurate and personalized selection of movies.
