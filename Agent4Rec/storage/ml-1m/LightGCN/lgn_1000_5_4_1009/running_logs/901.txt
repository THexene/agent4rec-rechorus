REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in recommending movies that align with my movie tastes. I appreciated the suggestions of "Godfather: Part II" and "Rear Window" as they had intense and gripping storylines, which I enjoy. However, I was disappointed that the system didn't offer more diverse and unconventional movie choices, considering my preference for unique storytelling styles.
