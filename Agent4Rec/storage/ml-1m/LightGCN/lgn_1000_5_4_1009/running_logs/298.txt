        Act as user 298, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 out of 10. While it did recommend some movies that I enjoyed, such as "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" and "Pulp Fiction," there were also several movies that I disliked, such as "Fargo," "Amadeus," and "Being John Malkovich." As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and it seems that the system did not fully understand my taste. Additionally, as a dedicated follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, and it seems that the system did not take that into account. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the recommendation results and would have preferred a more tailored and accurate selection of movies.
