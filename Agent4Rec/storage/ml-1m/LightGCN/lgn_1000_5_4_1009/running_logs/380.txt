        Relevant context from user 380's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Groundhog Day, There's Something About Mary, Pleasantville, Notting Hill, among them, I watched ['Groundhog Day'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ["There's Something About Mary", 'Pleasantville'].

- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them.
        Act as user 380, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and it is important for the recommender system to respect those preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, which is important for an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer like myself. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
