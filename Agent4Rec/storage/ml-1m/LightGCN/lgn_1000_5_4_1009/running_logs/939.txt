        Act as user 939, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and satisfy my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the majority of the movies recommended to me did not match my preferences. Despite watching some movies and giving them ratings based on historical ratings, I still ended up disliking the majority of the suggested movies. This indicates that the conformity aspect of the recommender system, which heavily relies on historical ratings, did not work well for me. Additionally, the system did not seem to understand my preference for action-packed, thought-provoking, classic, comedy-drama, and suspenseful movies. The lack of diversity in the recommendations also contributed to my dissatisfaction. Overall, this recommender system did not effectively cater to my specific movie tastes and failed to provide satisfactory recommendations.
