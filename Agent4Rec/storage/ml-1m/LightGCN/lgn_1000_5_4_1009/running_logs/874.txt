        Relevant context from user 874's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Fly, The (1958), Psycho (1960), Night of the Living Dead (1968), Mummy, The (1959), among them, I watched ['Fly, The (1958)', 'Psycho (1960)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Night of the Living Dead (1968)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Dracula (1931), Raven, The (1963), Somewhere in Time (1980), Exorcist, The (1973), among them, I watched ['Dracula (1931)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Raven, The (1963)', 'Somewhere in Time (1980)', 'Exorcist, The (1973)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately predict my preferences and I disliked most of the recommended movies.
        Act as user 874, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not accurately predict my movie preferences and I disliked most of the recommended movies. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes in movies, particularly in the horror genre. However, the system failed to understand my preferences and recommended movies that did not align with my interests. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and the fact that I am a Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings. This lack of personalization and understanding of my movie-watching habits left me unsatisfied with the recommendations. Therefore, I cannot rate this recommender system higher than a 3.
