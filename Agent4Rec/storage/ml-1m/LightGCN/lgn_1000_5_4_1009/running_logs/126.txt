        Act as user 126, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide satisfactory recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and preferences. However, the system recommended movies that did not align with my preferences, resulting in a high number of dislikes. Additionally, the system did not take into account my activity trait, as it continued to suggest movies even after I expressed dissatisfaction with the recommendations. Furthermore, the conformity trait of the system did not cater to my individuality, as it heavily relied on historical ratings instead of considering my personal preferences. Overall, this recommender system did not understand my selective viewing habits and failed to provide recommendations that matched my taste, leading to a low level of satisfaction.
