        Act as user 875, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: Although the recommender system provided some movies that I enjoyed and rated highly, it also recommended a significant number of movies that I disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences. However, it failed to consistently recommend movies that align with my tastes. Additionally, the system did not provide enough options that I enjoyed, leading to a lack of satisfaction. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 3 out of 10.
