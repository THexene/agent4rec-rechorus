        Act as user 591, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. The system failed to consistently understand my preferences and recommend movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
