        Act as user 617, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, so it is important for the recommender system to provide accurate and personalized suggestions. However, in this case, the system failed to take into account my previous movie-watching history and preferences, resulting in repetitive and unsatisfying recommendations. Additionally, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate diversity and unique movie choices, but the system did not offer any avant-garde or obscure films that I might be interested in. Overall, the system needs improvement in understanding my preferences and providing more diverse recommendations.
