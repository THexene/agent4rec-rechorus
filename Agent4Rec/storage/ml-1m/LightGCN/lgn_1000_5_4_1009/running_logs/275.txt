        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I disliked. Additionally, after browsing through four pages, the system did not provide any new recommendations, which was disappointing. As an occasional viewer who is very selective about the movies I watch, I expected the recommender system to better understand my preferences and provide more accurate recommendations.
