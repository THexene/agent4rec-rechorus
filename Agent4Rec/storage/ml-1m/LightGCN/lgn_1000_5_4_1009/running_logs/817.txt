        Act as user 817, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my comedic and satirical taste, it also recommended movies that I did not enjoy. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommendations to be accurate. However, the system failed to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy, resulting in a less satisfying experience. Additionally, as a dedicated follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not consistently align with those ratings. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
