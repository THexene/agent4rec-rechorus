        Act as user 900, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the occasional movie recommendations that align with my taste, the system failed to consistently provide me with movies that I enjoyed. The majority of the recommended movies did not match my preferences, resulting in a high number of unsatisfied memories. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to suggest movies that I had already expressed dislike for. As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I expect a higher level of accuracy and personalization from a recommender system.
