        Relevant context from user 991's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Touch of Evil, Asphalt Jungle, The, Wrong Man, The, Rear Window, among them, I watched ['Touch of Evil', 'Rear Window'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Wrong Man, The'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Double Indemnity, Devil in a Blue Dress, Thin Man, The, Streetcar Named Desire, A, among them, I watched ['Double Indemnity', 'Thin Man, The'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Thin Man, The', 'Devil in a Blue Dress', 'Streetcar Named Desire, A'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations.
        Act as user 991, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my incredibly infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to provide me with any new recommendations beyond the first two pages. It suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. As an elusive occasional viewer, I expect the recommender system to be able to offer a wider range of options that align with my taste in classic film noir, thrillers, and sci-fi adventures. The system's inability to provide fresh and diverse recommendations greatly diminishes its usefulness to me.
