RATING: 4
REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. While it did recommend a movie that I enjoyed, the overall selection did not align with my specific tastes. I was looking for science fiction, comedy-adventure, psychological-thought-provoking, mystery-suspense, and visually stunning-artistic movies. However, the recommended movies did not cater to these preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety or options for me to explore. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and diverse selection of movies. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 4.
