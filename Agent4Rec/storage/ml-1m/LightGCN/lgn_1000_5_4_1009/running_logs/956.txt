        Act as user 956, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do decide to explore, I expect the recommendations to strictly align with my taste. The system failed to meet this expectation as I disliked the majority of the recommended movies on each page. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have a high level of selectivity when it comes to movie choices, and the system did not offer enough variety or unconventional themes to capture my interest. Therefore, I am not satisfied with the recommender system and would rate it a 4.
