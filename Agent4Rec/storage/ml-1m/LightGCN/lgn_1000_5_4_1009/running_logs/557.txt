RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my interests, such as Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back and Blade Runner, the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. I appreciate the diversity of the recommendations, but they were too far outside of my usual taste. Additionally, the conformity aspect of the system, where it heavily relies on historical ratings, did not provide me with enough unique and obscure choices that I enjoy. Overall, I did not feel satisfied with the recommendations and will not be returning to this recommender system.
