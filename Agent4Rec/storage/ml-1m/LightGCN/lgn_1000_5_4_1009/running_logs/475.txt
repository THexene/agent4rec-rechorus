RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations as an Occasional Viewer with specific movie tastes. While I appreciate the effort to recommend movies based on my preferences, the majority of the recommendations did not align with my taste. I only enjoyed a few movies from each page of recommendations, and the rest were not to my liking. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my Maverick Critic conformity trait, as the recommended movies were often not rated highly by historical ratings. Overall, the system failed to consistently provide me with satisfying movie recommendations, resulting in a low rating.
