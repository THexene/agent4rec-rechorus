        Act as user 678, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I disliked in multiple pages. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do explore a recommendation system, I expect it to understand my preferences and provide me with tailored suggestions. However, this system failed to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy, which resulted in a lack of satisfaction. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have a very specific taste in movies, and I expect the recommender system to respect that and not suggest movies that are too far outside of my preferences. Unfortunately, this system did not meet my expectations in that regard either. Overall, while the system had some potential, it fell short in providing me with a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
