I dislike the rest movies: ['L.A. Confidential', 'Shawshank Redemption, The'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them to me.
        Act as user 182, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed my dissatisfaction with. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences and dislikes. However, this system seemed to overlook my feedback and continued to suggest movies that did not align with my taste. This lack of personalization and consideration for my preferences greatly diminished my satisfaction with the system.
