RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I was curious to see if this system could align with my taste. However, the recommendations provided did not match my preferences. Despite my specific movie tastes, the system suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows that the system did not take into account my previous interactions and preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer any variety or options that could potentially align with my taste. Overall, the recommender system failed to provide me with satisfying movie recommendations, resulting in my decision to exit the system after browsing just four pages.
