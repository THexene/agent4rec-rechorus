I appreciated the inclusion of classic and timeless movies like "Annie Hall" and "Citizen Kane," which I thoroughly enjoyed and rated highly. However, I was a bit disappointed with the inclusion of "Magnolia," as it didn't match my preferences and I didn't enjoy it. Overall, the system showed potential in understanding my cinematic trailblazer nature, but there is room for improvement in terms of better tailoring recommendations to my specific tastes.
