RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not accurately predict my movie preferences based on my ratings and dislikes. Despite providing clear feedback on the movies I enjoyed and disliked, the system continued to recommend movies that did not align with my tastes. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate recommendations. Unfortunately, this system failed to meet my expectations and did not enhance my movie-watching experience.
