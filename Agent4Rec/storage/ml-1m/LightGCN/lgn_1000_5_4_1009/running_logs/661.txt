 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Terminator" and "Alien," it also suggested movies that I did not enjoy, like "Saving Private Ryan" and "Goldfinger." Additionally, the system did not recommend any movies that I particularly enjoy, such as sci-fi or action movies. The lack of personalized recommendations and the inclusion of movies I dislike made the overall experience unsatisfying.
