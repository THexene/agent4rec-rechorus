        Relevant context from user 937's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Matrix, The, among them, I watched ['Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi', 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Alien (1979), Jurassic Park (1993), Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), among them, I watched ['Alien (1979)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Jurassic Park (1993)', 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the system did not accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked.
        Act as user 937, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to accurately understand my movie preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and infrequent movie-watching habits. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as the Star Wars movies, it also suggested movies like Jurassic Park and Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, which I explicitly stated that I disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my preferences and a failure to consider my previous ratings. Additionally, the system did not offer enough diversity in its recommendations, as it mainly focused on action-packed and science fiction movies, without considering my enjoyment of classic movies, historical settings, and crime thrillers. Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system's performance.
