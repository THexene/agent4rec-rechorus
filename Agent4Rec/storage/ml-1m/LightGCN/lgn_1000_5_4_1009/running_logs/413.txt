        Act as user 413, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that align with my specific tastes, which include action-packed movies, sci-fi and fantasy movies, classic and cult movies, dramatic and emotional movies, thriller and mystery movies, and animated and family movies. However, the recommendations provided by the system did not cater to my preferences. 

Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. Unfortunately, the system did not provide enough information about the historical ratings of the recommended movies, making it difficult for me to conform to my usual rating patterns.

Furthermore, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I enjoy exploring unique and obscure movies. However, the recommendations I received were mostly popular and well-known movies, which did not align with my desire for diversity in movie choices.

Overall, the recommender system failed to satisfy my specific tastes, conform to my rating patterns, and provide diverse and unique movie recommendations. Therefore, I rate it a 3.
