RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the occasional exploration of different genres, the system failed to provide me with movies that align with my preferred tastes. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones recommended to me, and the majority of them did not match my preferences. As an occasional viewer, I rely on the recommender system to suggest movies that strictly align with my taste, and this system did not meet my expectations. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed dislike for. Overall, the recommender system did not effectively cater to my movie-watching habits and preferences, leading to my dissatisfaction.
