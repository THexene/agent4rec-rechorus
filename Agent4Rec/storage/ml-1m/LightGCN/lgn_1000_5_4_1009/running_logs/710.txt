RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it did not accurately predict my movie preferences and the majority of the recommended movies were not to my liking. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. I enjoy suspenseful and thrilling movies, thought-provoking and mind-bending movies, classic and iconic movies, psychological and character-driven movies, as well as drama and emotional movies. However, the recommender system failed to take these preferences into account and recommended movies that did not align with my taste. Additionally, the system did not consider my previous ratings and the movies I disliked, resulting in a poor recommendation experience. As a Balanced Evaluator, I expect the recommender system to consider both historical ratings and personal preferences, but this system fell short in that regard. Therefore, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system and would not recommend it to others.
