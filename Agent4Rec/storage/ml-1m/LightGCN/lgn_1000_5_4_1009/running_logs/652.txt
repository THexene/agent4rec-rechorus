        Relevant context from user 652's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Annie Hall, The Graduate, Citizen Kane, Some Like It Hot, among them, I watched ['Annie Hall', 'The Graduate'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['The Graduate'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Lawrence of Arabia, Casablanca, Singin' in the Rain, among them, I watched ["One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Casablanca'] and rate them ['4', '4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ["Singin' in the Rain"].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them.
        Act as user 652, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and it is important for the recommender to respect those preferences. Additionally, as a dedicated follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, so it would have been helpful if the system had taken that into consideration as well. The lack of personalization and consideration for my preferences left me unsatisfied with the recommendations.
