        Relevant context from user 230's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Erin Brockovich, Poseidon Adventure, The, Eyes Wide Shut, Silence of the Lambs, The, among them, I watched ['Erin Brockovich'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Poseidon Adventure, The', 'Eyes Wide Shut'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Gods and Monsters, Schindler's List, Gladiator, Sense and Sensibility, among them, I watched ['Gods and Monsters'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ["Schindler's List", 'Gladiator'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I disliked on both pages.
        Act as user 230, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to understand my movie preferences and consistently recommended movies that I disliked. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately suggest movies that align with my tastes. However, the system recommended movies like "Poseidon Adventure, The" and "Eyes Wide Shut" on the first page, and "Schindler's List" and "Gladiator" on the second page, which are not in line with my preference for romantic dramas, thought-provoking films, and character-driven movies. This lack of understanding and inability to provide suitable recommendations left me unsatisfied and compelled me to exit the system immediately.
