REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my preferences, it failed to take into account my dislikes. I clearly indicated that I disliked certain movies, yet the system continued to recommend them to me. This shows a lack of understanding and consideration for my preferences.

Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
