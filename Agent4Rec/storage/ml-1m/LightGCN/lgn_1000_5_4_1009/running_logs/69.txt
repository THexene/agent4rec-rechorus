RATING: 4; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and rarely watch movies. However, the system failed to provide me with new and unique recommendations that align with my diverse movie preferences. The recommendations were mostly mainstream and popular movies, which did not cater to my cinematic trailblazer nature. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the variety of movies suggested to me. Overall, the recommender system did not understand my unique movie-watching habits and failed to provide me with satisfactory recommendations.
