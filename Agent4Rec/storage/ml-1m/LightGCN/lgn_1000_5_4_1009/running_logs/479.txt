RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did provide some movie recommendations that aligned with my tastes, such as "French Connection, The" and "Casablanca," the subsequent recommendations on page 2 did not interest me. I was hoping for more diverse and unique movie choices, but the system seemed to rely heavily on popular and well-known movies. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences when generating subsequent recommendations. Overall, I was not fully satisfied with the recommender system's ability to cater to my specific movie preferences and provide a diverse range of recommendations.
