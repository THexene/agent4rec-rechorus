        Relevant context from user 28's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Beetlejuice (1988), Sixteen Candles (1984), Fish Called Wanda, A (1988), Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), among them, I watched ['Beetlejuice (1988)', 'Sixteen Candles (1984)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Sixteen Candles (1984)', 'Fish Called Wanda, A (1988)', 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Adventures in Babysitting (1987), Fletch (1985), Weird Science (1985), Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), among them, I watched ['Adventures in Babysitting (1987)', 'Weird Science (1985)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Weird Science (1985)', 'Fletch (1985)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 28, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. The system recommended movies to me that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences, and I expect the recommender system to understand and cater to those preferences. However, the system failed to do so by suggesting movies that did not align with my taste. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it recommended movies that I had already rated negatively. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences greatly diminished my satisfaction with the recommender system.
