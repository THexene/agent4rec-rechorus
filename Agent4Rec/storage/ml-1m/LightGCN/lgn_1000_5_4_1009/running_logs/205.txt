        Act as user 205, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and infrequent movie-watching habits. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my viewing history and preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer enough diversity in its recommendations, as it mostly stuck to my preferred movie types without exploring different genres. Lastly, the conformity aspect of the system, considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, did not seem to be effective in providing me with accurate recommendations. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt the system did not cater to my unique movie-watching habits and preferences.
