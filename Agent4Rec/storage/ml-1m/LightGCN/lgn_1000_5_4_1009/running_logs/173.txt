        Act as user 173, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: Although the recommender system provided some movie recommendations that aligned with my taste, it failed to consistently suggest movies that I enjoyed. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not offer any new recommendations that appealed to my diverse and avant-garde taste. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it suggested movies that were not in line with my preferred genres. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, and this system did not meet my expectations. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 3.
