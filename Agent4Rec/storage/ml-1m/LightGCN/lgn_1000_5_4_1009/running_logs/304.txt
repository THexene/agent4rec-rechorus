        Act as user 304, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to align with my movie preferences and did not provide satisfactory recommendations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste, which includes action-packed, suspenseful, crime and heist, comedy, adventure and thriller movies, as well as movies with unique and unconventional storylines. However, the recommender system suggested movies like American Beauty, Forrest Gump, Braveheart, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, and Being John Malkovich, which do not fall within my preferred genres. 

Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. However, the recommender system did not take this into account and recommended movies that I disliked in both page 1 and page 2. This lack of conformity to my historical ratings further decreased my satisfaction with the system.

Furthermore, as a Niche Explorer, I occasionally explore different genres but mostly stick to my preferred movie types. The recommender system did not provide enough diversity in its recommendations, as it consistently suggested movies that did not align with my taste.

Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations as an Occasional Viewer, Dedicated Follower, and Niche Explorer. It failed to provide satisfactory recommendations that aligned with my movie preferences, historical ratings, and desire for diversity. Hence, I rate this recommender system a 3.
