- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 211, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 4 because it did not align well with my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do explore a recommendation system, I expect it to understand my taste and provide relevant suggestions. However, this system failed to do so. Despite my clear movie preferences, the recommendations I received on all three pages did not match my interests. I only enjoyed and rated positively one movie out of the nine I watched, and the rest were not to my liking. This lack of alignment with my taste left me unsatisfied with the recommendations provided. As an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have high expectations for movie recommendations, and unfortunately, this system did not meet them.
