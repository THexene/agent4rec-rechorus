You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 946 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy mystery and suspense movies.;  appreciate romantic dramas.;  have a preference for classic films.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 946, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because I was not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and the system failed to consistently recommend movies that aligned with my tastes. While I did find a few movies that I enjoyed and rated highly, the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. Overall, I did not feel that the recommender system understood my preferences well enough and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
