RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, there were also a significant number of movies that I did not enjoy. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, and I only watch movies that strictly align with my taste. However, this system recommended movies that I disliked on multiple occasions, which was disappointing. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences when generating subsequent recommendations. Overall, I did not feel satisfied with the recommender system as it did not consistently provide me with movies that I would enjoy.
