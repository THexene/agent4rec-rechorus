I dislike the rest movies: ['Graduate, The', 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them.
        Act as user 988, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my preferences, it failed to take into account my dislikes. I clearly expressed my dislike for certain movies, yet the system continued to recommend them to me. This lack of personalization and consideration for my preferences greatly diminished my satisfaction with the system. Additionally, the system did not offer any variety or diversity in its recommendations, sticking to the same genres and themes that I already enjoy. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
