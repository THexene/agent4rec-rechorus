        Relevant context from user 237's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Armageddon (1998), Wild Wild West (1999), Star Trek: Generations (1994), Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), among them, I watched ['Armageddon (1998)', 'Star Trek: Generations (1994)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively.

I dislike the rest movies: ['Anaconda (1997)'].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 237, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to satisfy my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the system recommended several movies that I disliked, such as "Wild Wild West", "Arachnophobia", "End of Days", and "Anaconda". These movies do not match my preference for thrilling and suspenseful movies, science fiction and fantasy movies, action-packed and adrenaline-pumping movies, classic and iconic movies, adventure and escapism, and movies with a touch of humor and comedy. 

Although I did enjoy some of the movies recommended, such as "Armageddon", "Star Trek: Generations", and "Star Trek: First Contact", the majority of the recommendations did not meet my expectations. As an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I meticulously curate my movie choices to match my personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety. Therefore, the lack of alignment between the recommended movies and my preferences greatly affected my satisfaction with the recommender system.

Furthermore, as a Balanced Evaluator, I consider both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. However, the system did not provide enough information about historical ratings, making it difficult for me to trust the recommendations. This lack of transparency in the recommendation process also contributed to my dissatisfaction.

Overall, while the recommender system had some potential with a few satisfactory recommendations, it ultimately failed to consistently align with my taste and provide the level of selectivity I desire. Hence, I rate this recommender system a 3.
