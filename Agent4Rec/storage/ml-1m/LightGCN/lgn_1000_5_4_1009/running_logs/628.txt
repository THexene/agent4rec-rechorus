RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system provided some good recommendations that aligned with my movie tastes, such as Blade Runner and Alien. However, there were also a few movies that I disliked, like Chinatown and Cool Hand Luke. The system did not fully understand my preferences and failed to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its recommendations, often suggesting movies from the same genres or time periods. Overall, while the system had some successes, it did not consistently meet my expectations and lacked the diversity I was seeking.
