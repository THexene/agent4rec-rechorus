 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations as an Occasional Viewer. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it seemed to focus on a narrow range of genres and did not offer any new or unconventional films. As a result, I did not find the recommendations to be helpful or satisfying, and I ultimately decided to leave the system after browsing only three pages.
