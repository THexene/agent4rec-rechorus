Relevant context from your memory:
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), Gladiator (2000), Rules of Engagement (2000), X-Men (2000), among them, I watched ['Gladiator (2000)', 'X-Men (2000)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Gone in 60 Seconds (2000)', 'Rules of Engagement (2000)'].

        Relevant context from user 198's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), Gladiator (2000), Rules of Engagement (2000), X-Men (2000), among them, I watched ['Gladiator (2000)', 'X-Men (2000)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Gone in 60 Seconds (2000)', 'Rules of Engagement (2000)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 198, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did suggest a couple of movies that aligned with my preferences, such as Gladiator and X-Men, I was disappointed that it recommended movies like Gone in 60 Seconds and Rules of Engagement, which I did not enjoy. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and prefer movies that fall within the genres I mentioned earlier. The system failed to consistently recommend movies that matched my preferences, and as a result, I am not fully satisfied with it.
