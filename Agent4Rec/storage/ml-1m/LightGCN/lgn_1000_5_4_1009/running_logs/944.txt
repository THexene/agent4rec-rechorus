        Relevant context from user 944's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: American Beauty, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Matrix, The, among them, I watched ['Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope', 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively.

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Blade Runner, Saving Private Ryan, Psycho, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, among them, I watched ['Blade Runner', 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Saving Private Ryan', 'Psycho'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations.
        Act as user 944, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the recommendations it provided. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, the recommender system failed to understand my unique taste and kept suggesting movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations beyond the first two pages, which further added to my dissatisfaction. I expected the system to provide me with thrilling and action-packed movies, sci-fi and fantasy films, and classic and iconic movies, but it fell short in delivering these recommendations. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide me with relevant and engaging movie suggestions.
