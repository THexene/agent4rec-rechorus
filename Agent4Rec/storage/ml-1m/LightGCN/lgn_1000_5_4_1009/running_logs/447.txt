RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my specific movie preferences and the system's ability to consider both historical ratings and personal preferences, the majority of the recommended movies did not align with my taste. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones I watched, and the rest were disappointing. As an occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in exploring movies that do not strictly align with my taste. Therefore, the recommender system failed to meet my expectations and provide satisfactory recommendations.
