RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. Additionally, it did not provide any new recommendations after a few pages. As an Occasional Viewer, I was hoping for a more diverse selection of movies that would cater to my specific tastes. The system's lack of variety and failure to consider my previous dislikes made it less satisfying for me.
