        Act as user 810, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an occasional viewer, I have limited time and patience to explore movies, so it is important for the recommender system to provide accurate and personalized recommendations. However, the system failed to do so by suggesting movies that I had already indicated my dislike for. This lack of attention to my preferences and previous interactions with the system left me unsatisfied and ultimately led me to exit the recommender system.
