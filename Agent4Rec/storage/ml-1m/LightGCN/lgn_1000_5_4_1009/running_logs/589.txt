However, I understand that no recommender system is perfect and it is challenging to cater to everyone's individual preferences. Despite this, I still found some enjoyable movies through the recommendations and appreciate the diversity in the selection. The system also took into account my ratings and adjusted its recommendations accordingly, which shows that it considers both historical ratings and personal preferences. Overall, I am satisfied with the recommender system, but there is room for improvement in terms of better understanding my specific movie preferences.
