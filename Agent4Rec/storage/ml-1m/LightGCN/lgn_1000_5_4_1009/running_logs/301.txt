 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide any new or diverse movie options that could have potentially caught my interest. As a Maverick Critic, I rely on my own taste and do not conform to historical ratings, so the system's reliance on those ratings was not helpful to me. Overall, the recommender system did not cater to my selective and specific movie tastes, resulting in a highly unsatisfactory experience.
