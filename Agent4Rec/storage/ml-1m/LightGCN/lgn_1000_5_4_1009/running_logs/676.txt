        Relevant context from user 676's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Galaxy Quest, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Back to the Future, Stuart Little, among them, I watched ['Galaxy Quest', 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively.

- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 676, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 out of 10. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my diverse taste and preferences, the system failed to take into account my activity trait as an incredibly elusive occasional viewer. It recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which left me unsatisfied. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it suggested similar movies on both pages. Overall, the system did not effectively cater to my unique movie-watching habits and failed to provide me with new and exciting options.
