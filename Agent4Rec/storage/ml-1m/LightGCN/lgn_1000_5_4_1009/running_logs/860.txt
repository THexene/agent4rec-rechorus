RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide me with movie recommendations that align with my taste. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I was curious to see if this system could suggest movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the recommendations I received on all four pages did not match my preferences. I only enjoyed a few movies and disliked the majority of the suggested films. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my movie preferences and failed to provide me with satisfying recommendations. As a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste, disregarding historical ratings. Therefore, the system's reliance on historical ratings did not influence my ratings. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have a very specific and curated taste in movies, and the system's lack of variety in its recommendations further contributed to my dissatisfaction. Overall, this recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide me with personalized and satisfying movie recommendations.
