RATING: 6
REASON: While the recommender system did provide me with a variety of movie recommendations, I found that it heavily relied on historical ratings and did not offer many new movies that aligned with my diverse and avant-garde taste. I appreciate that the system took into account my preferences for psychological thrillers, romantic dramas, thought-provoking and socially relevant movies, intense and gripping war movies, classic musicals, and independent and art-house films. However, I was disappointed that it did not introduce me to any new movies that I enjoyed or rated highly. Additionally, the system did not seem to adapt to my feedback and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed dislike for. Overall, while the recommender system had potential, it fell short in providing me with satisfying and novel movie recommendations.
