RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations as an occasional viewer with specific movie preferences. While I appreciate that the system recommended movies from the 1980s and 1990s, which aligns with my taste, the majority of the recommendations did not appeal to me. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones I watched, and the system failed to understand my preference for character-driven narratives with a mix of humor and heart. Additionally, the system did not take into account my dislike for certain genres, such as Dangerous Liaisons and Terms of Endearment. Overall, the recommendations were not tailored enough to my specific taste, leading to a lack of satisfaction.
