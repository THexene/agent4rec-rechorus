        Relevant context from user 108's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Wrong Man, The (1956), Laura (1944), Gilda (1946), Ed Wood (1994), among them, I watched ['Wrong Man, The (1956)', 'Laura (1944)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Ed Wood (1994)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Sunshine (1999), Clue (1985), Grifters, The (1990), Palmetto (1998), among them, I watched ['Sunshine (1999)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Clue (1985)', 'Grifters, The (1990)', 'Palmetto (1998)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I disliked on both page 1 and page 2.
        Act as user 108, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to understand my movie preferences and consistently recommended movies that I disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. I appreciate romantic dramas, classic films, sci-fi and fantasy movies, film noirs, and mystery and thriller movies. However, the recommender system did not take into account my preferences and instead suggested movies that did not align with my taste. This lack of understanding and personalization left me unsatisfied with the recommendations. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and do not rely on historical ratings. The fact that the recommender system seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings further diminished its usefulness for me. Overall, I found the recommendations to be disappointing and not reflective of my movie preferences, leading to a low rating of 2.
