- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 137, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and watch movies infrequently. However, the system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my preferences and a failure to provide me with new and diverse movie options. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I do not rely on historical ratings and evaluate movies solely based on my own taste. The system's recommendations seemed to be heavily influenced by historical ratings, which did not align with my preferences. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with personalized and suitable movie recommendations.
