I dislike the rest movies: ['Men in Black', 'U-571', 'High Fidelity'].
- Turn to page 3 of the recommendation.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I disliked most of the movies recommended to me.

- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 119, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and the system failed to understand and cater to them. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, resulting in repetitive recommendations of movies I had already expressed disinterest in. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie selection.
