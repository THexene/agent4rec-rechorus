- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked.

RATING: 3
REASON: The recommender system did not accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked. Despite providing ratings for the movies I watched, the system failed to adjust its recommendations accordingly. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences and provide relevant recommendations. Unfortunately, this system fell short in meeting my expectations.
