        Act as user 411, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to accurately recommend movies that align with my taste. The majority of the recommended movies did not appeal to me, and I had to rely on my own selective choices to find movies that I enjoyed. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the diversity of the recommendations and did not allow for independent opinions. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations as an elusive occasional viewer with specific movie preferences.
