        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. I enjoy suspenseful thrillers, psychological dramas, coming-of-age films, classic movies, crime and mystery movies, as well as unconventional and cult films. However, the recommendations I received did not align with my preferences. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones recommended to me, and the majority of them were not to my liking. Additionally, the system heavily relies on historical ratings, which may not accurately reflect my personal taste. Overall, the lack of personalized and diverse recommendations left me unsatisfied with the system.
