        Act as user 326, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I was curious to see if this system could align with my taste. However, I found that the majority of the movies recommended to me were not to my liking. Despite the fact that I provided ratings for the movies I watched, the system continued to suggest movies that I had already watched and disliked. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences left me unsatisfied. Additionally, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate diversity and unique movie choices, but the recommendations seemed to be more mainstream and did not offer the avant-garde options I was hoping for. Overall, the system did not effectively cater to my specific movie tastes and failed to provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
