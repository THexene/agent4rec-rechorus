        Act as user 422, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: Although the recommender system provided some movie recommendations that aligned with my taste, the majority of the recommended movies were not to my liking. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and the system failed to consistently suggest movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences left me unsatisfied with the overall experience.
