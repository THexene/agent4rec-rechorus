        Act as user 285, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and it is important for the recommender system to consider my dislikes in order to provide accurate recommendations. Additionally, as a dedicated follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not seem to take this into account either. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not understand my movie preferences well enough.
