        Act as user 373, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, and I have a limited number of movies that I am interested in watching. The system failed to understand my preferences and did not provide me with enough options that I would enjoy. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, which resulted in repetitive recommendations. As a Balanced Evaluator, I expect the system to consider both historical ratings and personal preferences, but it seemed to prioritize historical ratings more. Overall, the lack of personalization and repetitive recommendations made me unsatisfied with the recommender system.
