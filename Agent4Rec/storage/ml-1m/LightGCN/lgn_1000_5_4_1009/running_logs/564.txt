        Relevant context from user 564's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Matrix, The (1999), Fifth Element, The (1997), Predator 2 (1990), Alien (1979), among them, I watched ['Matrix, The (1999)', 'Fifth Element, The (1997)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Predator 2 (1990)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Thing, The (1982), Star Trek: First Contact (1996), Alien: Resurrection (1997), Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), among them, I watched ['Thing, The (1982)', 'Star Trek: First Contact (1996)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Star Trek: First Contact (1996)', 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 564, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my incredibly infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to provide me with a diverse range of recommendations. It repeatedly suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not take into account my maverick critic trait, as it relied heavily on historical ratings rather than evaluating movies solely based on my own taste. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not cater to my selective and exclusive movie choices.
