- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked.

        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to accurately understand my preferences. It recommended movies that I had no interest in, and even after providing ratings for the movies I did watch, it continued to suggest movies that I disliked. The system did not take into account my specific tastes, such as my preference for action-packed movies, thought-provoking dramas, and suspenseful thrillers. Additionally, it did not consider my interest in historical and war-themed movies or movies with unique storytelling. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not provide relevant and tailored recommendations.
