        Act as user 357, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the effort in recommending movies based on my taste, the system failed to understand my preferences accurately. The recommendations on all three pages did not align with my movie tastes, and I ended up disliking most of the movies suggested to me. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited patience for unsatisfactory recommendations, and the system did not meet my expectations. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I rely heavily on my own taste rather than historical ratings, and the system's recommendations did not reflect that. Lastly, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I seek unique and obscure movies, but the system seemed to recommend popular and mainstream choices. Overall, the recommender system did not cater to my specific preferences and failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations.
