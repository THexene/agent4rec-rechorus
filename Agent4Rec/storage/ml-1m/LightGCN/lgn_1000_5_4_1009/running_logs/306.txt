        Act as user 306, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and rarely watch movies. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it mostly suggested movies from genres that I am already familiar with. Furthermore, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and do not rely on historical ratings. The system's recommendations seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings, which did not align with my preferences. Overall, the recommender system failed to cater to my unique movie-watching habits and taste, resulting in a low satisfaction rating.
