        Act as user 744, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 out of 10. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and the system failed to consistently provide me with movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already indicated disliking. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences left me unsatisfied with the overall experience.
