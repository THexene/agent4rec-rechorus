        Act as user 255, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: While the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my tastes, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and the system failed to consistently provide recommendations that catered to my taste. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I do not rely on historical ratings, so the system's reliance on them did not align with my evaluation criteria. The lack of variety in the recommendations also did not meet my expectations as an exceedingly discerning selective viewer. Overall, the system did not meet my needs and I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations.
