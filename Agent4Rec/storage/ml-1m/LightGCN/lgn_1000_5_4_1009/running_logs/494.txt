I dislike the rest movies: ['X-Files: Fight the Future, The (1998)', 'Independence Day (ID4) (1996)'].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 494, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 out of 10. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Men in Black" and "The Fifth Element," it also suggested movies that I clearly stated I disliked, such as "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" and "Forbidden Planet." Additionally, after browsing through three pages of recommendations, the system did not provide any new suggestions, which left me unsatisfied. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and expect the recommender system to understand and cater to them. Unfortunately, this system fell short in that regard.
