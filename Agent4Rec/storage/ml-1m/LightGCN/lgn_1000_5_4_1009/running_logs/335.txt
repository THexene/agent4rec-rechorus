I appreciated that it suggested movies like "Schindler's List," "Saving Private Ryan," "Pulp Fiction," and "Raiders of the Lost Ark," which are thrilling, emotional, and thought-provoking. The system also took into account my balanced evaluation of historical ratings and personal preferences, as I rated these movies highly despite some differences from the historical ratings. However, I was disappointed that the system did not offer any new recommendations after browsing through three pages. It suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, which made me feel unsatisfied and prompted me to exit the system. Overall, while the recommender system had its strengths, it fell short in providing a continuous stream of diverse and engaging movie recommendations.
