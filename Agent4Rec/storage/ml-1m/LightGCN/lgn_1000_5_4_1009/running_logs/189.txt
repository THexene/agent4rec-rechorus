        Relevant context from user 189's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Psycho (1960), Shining, The (1980), Misery (1990), Scream (1996), among them, I watched ['Psycho (1960)', 'Shining, The (1980)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Poltergeist (1982), Nightmare on Elm Street, A (1984), Thing, The (1982), American Werewolf in London, An (1981), among them, I watched ['Poltergeist (1982)', 'Nightmare on Elm Street, A (1984)', 'Thing, The (1982)'] and rate them ['4', '4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Thing, The (1982)', 'American Werewolf in London, An (1981)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender system did not accurately predict my movie preferences and recommended movies that I disliked.
        Act as user 189, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my unique and diverse movie tastes, the system failed to accurately predict my preferences and recommended movies that I disliked. The system did not take into account my fondness for horror, thriller, fantasy, adventure, classic, critically acclaimed, supernatural, paranormal, family-friendly, and comedic movies. Additionally, the recommendations were not aligned with my previous ratings and did not consider my balance evaluation of historical ratings and personal preferences. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I expected the recommender system to provide me with more tailored and accurate recommendations. Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations.
