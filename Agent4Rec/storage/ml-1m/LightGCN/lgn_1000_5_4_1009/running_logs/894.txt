        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific and selective movie tastes, and this system did not accurately cater to my preferences. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the recommendations on all three pages did not align with my interests. I only enjoyed and rated positively one movie out of the six I watched, which is a low success rate for me. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety or diversity in its recommendations, as it consistently suggested movies that I did not enjoy. Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system's performance and its inability to provide me with suitable movie suggestions.
