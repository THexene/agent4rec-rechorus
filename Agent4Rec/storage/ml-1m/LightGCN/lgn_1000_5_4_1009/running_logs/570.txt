RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While I appreciate the system considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, it did not accurately capture my preferences. The recommendations it provided were not aligned with my movie tastes, and even when I did watch the recommended movies, I found myself unsatisfied with the choices. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations based on my preferences after browsing through multiple pages. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not successfully cater to my selective viewing habits.
