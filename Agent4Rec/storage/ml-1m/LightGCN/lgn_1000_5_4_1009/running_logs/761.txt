RATING: 4; REASON: I am not very satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I did not enjoy.

Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide enough accurate recommendations for my specific movie taste.
