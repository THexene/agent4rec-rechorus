        Act as user 689, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do decide to watch a movie, I expect the recommendations to strictly align with my taste. However, this system recommended movies that I did not enjoy on multiple occasions, which left me unsatisfied. Additionally, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate diverse and unique movie choices, but this system seemed to focus more on mainstream and popular movies. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and failed to consistently provide recommendations that I would enjoy.
