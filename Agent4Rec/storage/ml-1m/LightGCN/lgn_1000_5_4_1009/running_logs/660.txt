        Act as user 660, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 out of 10. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back and Aliens, it also recommended movies like Fargo that I disliked. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it mostly stuck to the same genres that I already enjoy. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for more diverse and unexpected recommendations that would pique my interest. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and left me unsatisfied.
