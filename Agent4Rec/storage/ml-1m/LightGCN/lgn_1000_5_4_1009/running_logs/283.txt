RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system had some hits and misses in terms of movie recommendations. While I appreciated the system suggesting movies that aligned with my preferences, there were also instances where it recommended movies that I disliked. Additionally, the system did not recommend any movies that I enjoyed, which was disappointing. The system's ability to consider both historical ratings and personal preferences was commendable, but it could have been more accurate in predicting my movie tastes. Overall, the system had potential but fell short in delivering satisfactory recommendations.
