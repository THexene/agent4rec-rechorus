RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and preferences. While I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my preferred genres, I found that a significant number of the recommended movies did not align with my taste. I disliked most of the movies that I watched and felt unsatisfied with the overall selection. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed dislike for. Overall, I did not find the recommendations to be accurate or tailored to my preferences, leading to my dissatisfaction with the recommender system.
