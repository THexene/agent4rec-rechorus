RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system had some hits and misses. While it did recommend a few movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Scream" and "Pulp Fiction," there were also several movies that I disliked and had already watched. The system did not provide enough new recommendations to keep me engaged. Additionally, it did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences when suggesting movies. Overall, the system had potential but fell short in delivering personalized and satisfying recommendations.
