As a Movie Enthusiast, I have an insatiable appetite for films and I am willing to watch nearly every movie recommended to me. However, the system failed to understand my diverse taste in movies and mainly suggested popular mainstream movies that did not cater to my preference for unique and obscure films.

Overall, I was not satisfied with the recommender system as it did not meet my expectations and failed to provide me with a diverse range of movies that I would enjoy.
