RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I was curious to see if this system could align with my taste. However, I found that the majority of the movies recommended to me did not align with my preferences. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones I watched, and the rest were not to my liking. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my movie preferences. Additionally, I did not appreciate the lack of diversity in the recommendations. The system seemed to focus on a specific genre and did not offer a wide range of options. Overall, I was not satisfied with the recommendations provided by this system.
