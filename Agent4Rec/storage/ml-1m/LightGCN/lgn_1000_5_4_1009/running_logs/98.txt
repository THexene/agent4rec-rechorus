RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to consistently provide movie recommendations that aligned with my personal taste. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences when it comes to movies, and I appreciate thrilling action movies, well-crafted science fiction films, epic adventure movies, intense psychological thrillers, emotionally impactful dramas, and thought-provoking and mind-bending movies. However, the recommendations I received on all three pages did not meet my criteria. While I did enjoy a couple of the movies I watched, the majority of the recommended movies were not to my liking. This lack of alignment with my preferences left me feeling unsatisfied with the recommender system. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
