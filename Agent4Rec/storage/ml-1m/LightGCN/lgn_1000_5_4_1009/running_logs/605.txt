        Act as user 605, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the majority of the recommended movies did not match my preferences. I only enjoyed a few movies like Casablanca, Saving Private Ryan, Aliens, and Braveheart. The rest of the recommended movies, such as Dances with Wolves, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Rocky, Godfather, The, and many others, were not to my liking. 

Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. However, the recommender system did not take this into account and recommended movies that I did not enjoy. This lack of conformity to my historical ratings further contributed to my dissatisfaction with the system.

Furthermore, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate diverse and unique movies. Unfortunately, the recommender system failed to provide me with a wide range of options that align with my diverse taste. It mainly suggested popular and mainstream movies, which did not cater to my preference for avant-garde and obscure films.

Overall, the recommender system did not fulfill my expectations as an Occasional Viewer, Dedicated Follower, and Cinematic Trailblazer. It failed to recommend movies that strictly align with my taste, did not consider my reliance on historical ratings, and lacked diversity in its suggestions. Hence, I rate this recommender system a 3.
