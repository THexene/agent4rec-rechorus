RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, this recommender system failed to provide me with new and diverse recommendations. It repeatedly suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, which was disappointing. Additionally, the system did not take into account my preference for intense and thought-provoking dramas, action-packed and thrilling movies, historical and war films, movies with strong character development and inspirational themes, and classic and timeless movies. Instead, it seemed to rely heavily on historical ratings, which did not align with my taste. Overall, this recommender system did not cater to my unique movie-watching habits and preferences, resulting in a low satisfaction rating.
