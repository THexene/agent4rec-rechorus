        Act as user 122, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and rarely watch movies. However, the system recommended movies that I had already watched and rated, which was disappointing. Additionally, I disliked the majority of the movies that were recommended to me. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my movie tastes and failed to provide me with satisfying recommendations. Therefore, I cannot say that I am satisfied with this recommender system.
