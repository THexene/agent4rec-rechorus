        Relevant context from user 741's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Ghostbusters (1984), Misery (1990), Thing, The (1982), Psycho (1960), among them, I watched ['Ghostbusters (1984)', 'Thing, The (1982)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Misery (1990)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: 13th Warrior, The (1999), Stir of Echoes (1999), Sleepy Hollow (1999), Boys Don't Cry (1999), among them, I watched ['13th Warrior, The (1999)', 'Stir of Echoes (1999)', 'Sleepy Hollow (1999)'] and rate them ['4', '4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Sleepy Hollow (1999)', "Boys Don't Cry (1999)"].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I disliked some of the movies that were recommended to me.
        Act as user 741, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Ghostbusters" and "The Thing," there were also several movies that I disliked, such as "Misery" and "Sleepy Hollow." This indicates that the system did not fully understand my preferences and failed to provide accurate recommendations. Additionally, the fact that I had to browse through two pages and still did not find satisfactory recommendations is disappointing. Overall, I would rate this recommender system a 4 because it had some hits but also many misses.
