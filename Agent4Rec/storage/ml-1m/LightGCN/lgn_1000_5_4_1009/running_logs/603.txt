        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I was curious to see if this system could align with my taste. However, I found that the majority of the recommended movies did not appeal to me. I only enjoyed and rated positively a few movies, such as "Godfather: Part II" and "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb." The rest of the recommendations were not to my liking, and I had to exit the system after browsing three pages. The system failed to understand my preferences and did not provide enough variety or diversity in its recommendations. Therefore, I cannot rate it higher than a 3.
