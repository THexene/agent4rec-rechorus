        Relevant context from user 541's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Four Weddings and a Funeral, When Harry Met Sally..., Back to the Future, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, among them, I watched ['Four Weddings and a Funeral', 'When Harry Met Sally...'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively.

        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: The recommender system did an okay job in recommending movies that aligned with my tastes. I appreciated the suggestions of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and "When Harry Met Sally..." as they are romantic comedies, which I enjoy. However, the system also recommended movies like "Back to the Future," which is not my cup of tea. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and the system failed to fully understand and cater to them. Additionally, I rely heavily on historical ratings when giving my own ratings, and the system did not provide enough information about the ratings of the recommended movies. Overall, while the system had some hits, it lacked the personalization and attention to detail that I require as a discerning selective viewer.
