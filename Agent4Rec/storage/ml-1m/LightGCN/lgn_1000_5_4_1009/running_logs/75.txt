        Act as user 75, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the majority of the movies recommended to me did not match my preferences. I only enjoyed a few movies and disliked the rest. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my movie preferences. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. But the system did not take this into account and recommended movies that I did not enjoy. Overall, the system failed to provide me with satisfactory recommendations, leading me to exit the system after browsing just three pages.
