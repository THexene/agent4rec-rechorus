RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the recommendations it provided. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the majority of the recommended movies did not match my preferences. I only enjoyed a few of the movies that I watched and rated. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This lack of personalization and consideration for my preferences made the recommendations ineffective for me. Therefore, I am not satisfied with this recommender system.
