        Act as user 395, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that I enjoyed, there were also a significant number of movies that I did not like. As a movie enthusiast, I have an insatiable appetite for films and I am willing to watch nearly every movie recommended to me. However, the majority of the movies suggested in this system did not align with my personal taste. Additionally, as a dedicated follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. Unfortunately, the system did not consistently recommend movies that had high historical ratings. Lastly, as an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I have a preference for specific genres such as classic comedies, sports-themed movies, 90s romantic dramas, quirky and offbeat superhero movies, and holiday-themed movies. The system did not consistently recommend movies that fell within these genres. Overall, while the system did have some hits, the lack of alignment with my personal taste and historical ratings makes me feel unsatisfied with the recommender system.
