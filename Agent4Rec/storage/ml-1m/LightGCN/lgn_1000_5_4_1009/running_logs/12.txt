RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific and diverse movie tastes, and I was hoping that the recommender system would understand and cater to that. However, the system recommended movies that did not align with my preferences, resulting in me disliking most of the movies it suggested. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and not historical ratings. Unfortunately, the system seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings, which led to further dissatisfaction. Overall, the system did not successfully capture my unique preferences and failed to provide me with compelling movie recommendations.
