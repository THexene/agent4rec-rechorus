        Act as user 473, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie-watching habits and preferences. However, the recommender system failed to provide me with diverse and unique movie recommendations. It kept suggesting movies that I had already watched and disliked, which was quite frustrating. Additionally, the system did not take into account my fear of spiders, as it recommended movies like Spider-Man which I would never watch. Overall, the system did not cater to my specific tastes and did not provide me with new and interesting movie options.
