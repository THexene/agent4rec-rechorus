        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 out of 10. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Amadeus" and "To Kill a Mockingbird," it also suggested movies that I clearly stated I disliked, such as "The Godfather" and "Silence of the Lambs." Additionally, the system did not provide any new recommendations that I enjoyed after browsing through three pages. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and accurate selection of movies that would cater to my specific preferences.
