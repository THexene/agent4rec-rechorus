        Act as user 383, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate that it recommended some movies that align with my taste, it also suggested movies that I clearly disliked in multiple pages. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited patience for unsatisfactory recommendations, and the fact that the system repeatedly suggested movies I disliked made me lose confidence in its ability to understand my preferences. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my preference for sci-fi and fantasy movies, which are genres I particularly enjoy. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and failed to consistently provide recommendations that aligned with my taste.
