I dislike the rest movies: ['Jaws (1975)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and rated, and also included movies that I disliked.
        Act as user 825, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and rated, which shows a lack of understanding of my movie-watching habits. Additionally, it included movies that I had explicitly expressed dislike for. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I expect the recommender system to provide me with fresh and tailored recommendations. However, this system failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with any new or interesting movie suggestions.
