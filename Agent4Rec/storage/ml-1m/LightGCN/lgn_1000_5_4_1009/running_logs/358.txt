        Act as user 358, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer. The recommendations provided did not align with my movie tastes, which are primarily focused on science fiction, adventure, creature features, futuristic thrillers, comedy, and classic sci-fi. The majority of the recommended movies were not of interest to me, and I ended up disliking them. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed dislike for. As a result, I found the recommendations to be unsatisfactory and decided to exit the system after browsing just three pages.
