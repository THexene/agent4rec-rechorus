RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" and "Blade Runner (1982)", it also recommended movies that I disliked, such as "Alien", "Aliens", and "Face/Off (1997)". The system did not take into account my preference for strong female leads or my fondness for 80s and 90s adventure films. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it kept suggesting similar genres and did not consider my interest in heartwarming and family-friendly movies or psychological and thought-provoking films. Overall, the recommender system failed to meet my expectations and did not accurately capture my unique and diverse movie preferences.
