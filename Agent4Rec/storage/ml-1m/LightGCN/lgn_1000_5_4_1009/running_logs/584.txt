        Relevant context from user 584's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982), Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), Back to the Future (1985), Blade Runner (1982), among them, I watched ['Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)', 'Back to the Future (1985)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Planet of the Apes (1968), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Abyss, The (1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), among them, I watched ['Planet of the Apes (1968)', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Abyss, The (1989)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 584, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an occasional viewer, I expect the recommender system to understand my preferences and not suggest movies that I have already indicated I do not enjoy. This lack of personalization and understanding of my previous interactions makes me question the effectiveness of the system. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its recommendations, as it mostly suggested movies from the same genre. Overall, I feel that the recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide me with satisfactory recommendations.
