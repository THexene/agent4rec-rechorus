I dislike the rest movies: ['Raging Bull (1980)', 'Straight Story, The (1999)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I disliked the majority of the recommended movies.
        Act as user 412, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific and selective movie tastes, and this system did not accurately cater to my preferences. Despite my diverse range of interests, including intense and thought-provoking movies, foreign films, historical and biographical movies, unique and unconventional plots, and movies with humor and wit, the recommendations I received were mostly not aligned with my preferences. 

Furthermore, as a Maverick Critic, I do not rely on historical ratings to evaluate movies. However, it seems that this recommender system heavily relies on historical ratings, as the movies it recommended were not in line with my taste and preferences. This lack of conformity to my individual taste was a major drawback for me.

Additionally, the recommender system did not take into account my exceedingly discerning and selective nature as a viewer. It failed to curate a list of movies that truly matched my personal taste, leaving me unsatisfied with the majority of the recommended movies.

Overall, this recommender system did not meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer with specific movie preferences. It lacked accuracy, failed to consider my non-conformist approach to movie ratings, and did not cater to my selective nature as a viewer. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 2.
