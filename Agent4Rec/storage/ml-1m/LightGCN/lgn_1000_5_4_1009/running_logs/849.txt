I dislike the rest movies: ['Silence of the Lambs, The'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations based on my preferences.
        Act as user 849, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it did not meet my expectations and left me unsatisfied. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, the recommender system failed to provide me with new recommendations based on my preferences. It recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my tastes. Additionally, the system did not offer any variety or diversity in its recommendations, as it kept suggesting movies from the same genres that I had already indicated a dislike for. Overall, the recommender system did not cater to my unique movie-watching habits and preferences, resulting in a disappointing experience.
