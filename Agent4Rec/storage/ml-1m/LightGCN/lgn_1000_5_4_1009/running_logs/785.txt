        Act as user 785, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend a few movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do decide to explore them, I expect the recommendations to strictly align with my taste. The fact that the system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked shows that it did not fully understand my preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough diversity in its recommendations. As a Cinematic Trailblazer, I am always seeking unique and obscure movies, but the system failed to offer any movies that defied categorization. Overall, while the system had some potential, it fell short in understanding my preferences and providing diverse recommendations.
