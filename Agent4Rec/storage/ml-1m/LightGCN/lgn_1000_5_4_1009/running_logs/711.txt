        Act as user 711, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to consistently recommend movies that align with my taste. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, and I only watch movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the recommender system recommended several movies that I disliked, such as "Arachnophobia (1990)", "L.A. Confidential (1997)", and "Braveheart (1995)". This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my preferences and failed to provide satisfactory recommendations. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and not historical ratings. The system's reliance on historical ratings did not align with my conformity trait, resulting in recommendations that did not match my preferences. Overall, the system's inability to consistently recommend movies that align with my taste and its reliance on historical ratings led to my dissatisfaction.
