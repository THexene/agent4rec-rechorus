RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. While I appreciate the effort in recommending movies based on my preferences, the system failed to consistently provide me with movies that I enjoyed. I disliked the majority of the recommended movies and only found a few that I actually liked. This indicates that the system did not fully understand my movie tastes and preferences. Additionally, the system did not take into account my preference for unique and obscure movies, as most of the recommendations were mainstream and popular films. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not enhance my movie-watching experience.
