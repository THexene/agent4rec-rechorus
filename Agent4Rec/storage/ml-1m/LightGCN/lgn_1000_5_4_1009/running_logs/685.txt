You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as a user exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie.

Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy classic movies with a touch of fantasy and adventure.;  appreciate witty and clever comedies.;  have a soft spot for romantic and heartwarming films.;  enjoy action-packed movies with a mix of comedy.;  appreciate movies that make me laugh out loud.. 
And your rating tendency is  You tend to give high ratings to classic movies, fantasy/adventure films, witty comedies, romantic movies, and action-packed films with comedy elements.
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Relevant context from user 685's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Lethal Weapon 2, Son in Law, Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult, Little Shop of Horrors, among them, I watched ['Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult'] and rate them ['4'] respectively.

I dislike the rest movies: ['Grumpy Old Men', 'King in New York, A'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 685, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and left me unsatisfied. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, this recommender system suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my preferences and a failure to provide me with new and exciting movie recommendations. Additionally, the system did not take into account my diverse taste in movies, as it continued to suggest movies that were similar to the ones I had already watched and disliked. Overall, the system did not meet my needs as a Balanced Evaluator with a selective taste in movies, and I was left feeling disappointed.
