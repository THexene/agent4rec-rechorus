REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my tastes, it also suggested movies that I disliked. Additionally, after browsing through three pages, the system did not provide any new recommendations based on my preferences. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and diverse selection of movies. The system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the variety of movies suggested. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not fully understand my unique movie preferences.
