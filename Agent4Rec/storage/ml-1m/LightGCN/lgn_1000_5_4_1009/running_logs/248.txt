        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not align with my movie preferences and I had a lot of unsatisfied memories. As an occasional viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the recommendations provided by the system did not consistently match my preferences. I disliked the majority of the movies recommended to me and only enjoyed a few. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my movie preferences and failed to provide recommendations that would satisfy my taste. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and do not consider historical ratings. Therefore, the system's reliance on historical ratings did not influence my ratings and did not contribute to my satisfaction with the recommendations. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I was left with a lot of unsatisfied memories, resulting in a low rating of 3.
