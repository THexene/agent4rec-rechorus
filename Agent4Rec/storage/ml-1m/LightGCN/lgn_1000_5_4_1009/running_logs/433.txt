        Relevant context from user 433's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Moonstruck, A Fish Called Wanda, Big, The Princess Bride, among them, I watched ['Moonstruck', 'The Princess Bride'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['A Fish Called Wanda', 'Big'].

- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I disliked on both page 1 and page 2.
        Act as user 433, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to understand my movie preferences and consistently recommended movies that I disliked. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and do not watch movies frequently. Therefore, it is crucial for a recommender system to accurately suggest movies that align with my preferences. However, this system repeatedly suggested movies that were not in line with my taste, resulting in a disappointing experience. Additionally, as a Balanced Evaluator, I consider both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. The system did not take this into account and recommended movies that had low historical ratings, further diminishing my satisfaction. Overall, this recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide me with suitable movie recommendations.
