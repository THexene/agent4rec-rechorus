RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in suggesting movies that align with my movie tastes. I enjoyed watching "Notorious" and "Sunset Blvd." as they were classic films with a touch of mystery and suspense, which I appreciate. The system also took into account my preference for atmospheric and visually stunning films. However, I was not satisfied with the other movie recommendations, "Grifters, The" and "Key Largo," as they did not match my preferences. Additionally, the system could have provided more variety in its recommendations, considering my diversity trait as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer. Overall, the system had some hits and misses, but it could be improved to better cater to my specific tastes and provide a wider range of movie options.
