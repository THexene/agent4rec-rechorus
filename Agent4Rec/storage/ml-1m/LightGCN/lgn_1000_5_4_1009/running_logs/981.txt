Based on my negative feelings and slight tiredness, I have no motivation to continue browsing the recommendation system.

[EXIT]; Reason: Unsatisfied with the recommendations and feeling a little tired.

You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 981 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Occasional Viewer, seldom attracted by movie recommendations. Only curious about watching movies that strictly align the taste. The movie-watching habits are not very infrequent. And you tend to exit the recommender system if you have a few unsatisfied memories.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: A Cinematic Trailblazer, a relentless seeker of the unique and the obscure in the world of movies. The movie choices are so diverse and avant-garde that they defy categorization.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy action-packed movies.;  appreciate classic horror films.;  have a soft spot for fantasy adventures.;  am a fan of science fiction.;  enjoy animated films.;  appreciate thought-provoking and surreal movies.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 981, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations as an Occasional Viewer. While it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows that the system did not take into account my previous interactions and preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough diverse and avant-garde movie recommendations, which is something I value as a Cinematic Trailblazer. Overall, the system failed to consistently provide satisfying recommendations, leading me to exit the system after browsing just a few pages.
