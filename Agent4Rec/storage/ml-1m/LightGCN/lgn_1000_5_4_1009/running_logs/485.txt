        Act as user 485, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I am not very satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. Additionally, after browsing through four pages, the system did not provide any new recommendations, which was disappointing. I was hoping for more diverse and unique movie suggestions, but the system seemed to be limited in that aspect. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I would rate it a 4.
