        Act as user 274, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to consistently provide me with movie recommendations that aligned with my taste. While I did enjoy a couple of the movies suggested to me, the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to suggest movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have high expectations for the recommendations I receive, and unfortunately, this system did not meet those expectations.
