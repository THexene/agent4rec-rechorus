        Act as user 451, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am extremely unsatisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and preferences. While I appreciate the system taking into account both historical ratings and personal preferences, it failed to accurately recommend movies that align with my interests. The majority of the movies recommended to me were not to my liking, and I had to exit the system after browsing just 4 pages. This lack of satisfaction and alignment with my preferences greatly impacts my rating of the recommender system.
