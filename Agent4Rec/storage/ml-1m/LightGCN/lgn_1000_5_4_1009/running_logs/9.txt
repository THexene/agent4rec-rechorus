[EXIT]; Reason: Lack of personalized recommendations and feeling very tired.

You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 9 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Maverick Critic who completely ignores historical ratings and evaluates movies solely based on own taste. Usually give ratings that are a lot different from historical ratings.
Your diversity trait is described as: A Niche Explorer who occasionally explores different genres and mostly sticks to preferred movie types.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy action-packed movies.;  appreciate thought-provoking and satirical films.;  have a preference for suspenseful and intense movies.;  enjoy movies with a mix of comedy and drama.;  have a liking for classic and nostalgic movies.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 9, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide personalized recommendations that align with my movie preferences. Despite indicating my specific tastes and preferences, the system repeatedly suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This lack of personalization greatly diminished my satisfaction with the system. Additionally, the system did not take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits, which further contributed to my dissatisfaction. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide a tailored movie recommendation experience.
