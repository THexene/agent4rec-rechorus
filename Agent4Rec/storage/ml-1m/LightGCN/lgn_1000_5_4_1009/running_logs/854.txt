        Act as user 854, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer. The system recommended movies that I had already expressed dislike for in previous pages, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it continued to suggest movies from the same genres and time periods. As a Maverick Critic, I rely on my own taste rather than historical ratings, so the system's reliance on those ratings did not align with my preferences. Overall, the system did not cater to my selective and diverse movie tastes, leading to a dissatisfying experience.
