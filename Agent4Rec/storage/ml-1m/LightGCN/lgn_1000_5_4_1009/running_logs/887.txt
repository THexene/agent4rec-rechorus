        Act as user 887, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my specific movie preferences and the system's attempt to recommend movies aligned with my taste, the majority of the recommended movies did not appeal to me. I found that the system failed to understand my unique preferences for intense and gritty movies, well-crafted crime dramas, thought-provoking and unconventional films, emotionally impactful and character-driven movies, as well as classic and iconic movies. The recommendations seemed to lack diversity and did not cater to my discerning and selective viewing habits. Additionally, the system's reliance on historical ratings did not align with my maverick critic approach, as I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste rather than following popular opinions. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide satisfactory movie recommendations.
