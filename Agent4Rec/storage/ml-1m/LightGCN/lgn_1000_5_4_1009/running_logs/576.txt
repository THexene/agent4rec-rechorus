REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations as an Occasional Viewer. I was only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste, but the majority of the recommended movies did not appeal to me. I appreciate that the system recommended some movies that I enjoyed, such as "Say Anything..." and "Rain Man", but overall, the system failed to consistently provide me with satisfying recommendations. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the diversity of the recommendations and did not allow for independent opinions. As a Niche Explorer, I was hoping for more variety in the recommended genres, but the system mostly stuck to my preferred movie types. Overall, while the system had some positive aspects, it fell short in meeting my specific preferences and needs as an Occasional Viewer.
