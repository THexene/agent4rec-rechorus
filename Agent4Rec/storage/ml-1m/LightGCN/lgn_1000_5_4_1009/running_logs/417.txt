        Act as user 417, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, and this system failed to capture my interest with its recommendations. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the system did not provide me with a satisfactory selection of movies. The majority of the recommended movies did not align with my taste, and I only enjoyed a few of them. Additionally, I disliked one of the recommended movies, which further contributed to my dissatisfaction. As a highly selective viewer, I expected the system to curate movies that closely matched my preferences, but it fell short in this regard. Therefore, I cannot rate this recommender system higher than a 3.
