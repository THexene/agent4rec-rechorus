        Act as user 558, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and rarely watch movies. However, the system did not take into account my unique movie tastes and instead recommended movies that I had already watched and enjoyed. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences left me unsatisfied with the recommendations. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the diversity of the recommendations and did not encourage me to explore different genres. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with relevant and enticing movie suggestions.
