        Act as user 33, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I am not very satisfied with the recommender system. Although I did find a few movies that I enjoyed, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked or did not watch. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited patience for recommendations that do not align with my taste. Additionally, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I was hoping for more diverse and avant-garde movie suggestions, but the system seemed to focus more on popular and mainstream films. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I would rate it a 4.
