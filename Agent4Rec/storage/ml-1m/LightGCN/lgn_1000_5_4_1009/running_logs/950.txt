RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in suggesting movies that aligned with my diverse taste. I appreciated the recommendations of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Blade Runner," as they were both thought-provoking and critically acclaimed movies. However, I was disappointed that the system didn't offer more options from the 1960s and earlier, as I particularly enjoy classic movies. Additionally, the system didn't cater to my preference for crime and mafia movies, dark comedies, and Westerns. Overall, while the system provided some satisfactory recommendations, it fell short in fully capturing my movie preferences.
