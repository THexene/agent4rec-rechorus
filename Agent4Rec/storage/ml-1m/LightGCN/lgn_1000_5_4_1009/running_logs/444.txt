RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in recommending movies that aligned with my preferred genres, such as action-packed thrillers and sci-fi adventures. I was satisfied with the recommendations for movies like Jurassic Park and The Matrix, as they were enjoyable to watch. However, I was disappointed with the recommendations for movies like American Beauty and Braveheart, as they did not match my taste at all. Additionally, the system only recommended movies on the first page, and I would have liked to see more options. Overall, while the system had some hits and misses, it provided me with a couple of movies that I enjoyed.
