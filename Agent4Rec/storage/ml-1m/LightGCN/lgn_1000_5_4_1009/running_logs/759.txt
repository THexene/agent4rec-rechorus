 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and the system failed to consistently provide me with movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I do not rely on historical ratings to evaluate movies, so the system's reliance on them did not align with my conformity trait. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I was left unsatisfied.
