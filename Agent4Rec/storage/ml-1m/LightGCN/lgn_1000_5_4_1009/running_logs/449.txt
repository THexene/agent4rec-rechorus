RATING: 5
REASON: The recommender system had some hits and misses in terms of movie recommendations. I appreciated that it suggested movies that aligned with my comedic and light-hearted preferences, such as "Toy Story" and "Pulp Fiction," which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, it also recommended movies like "Erin Brockovich" and "Gladiator" which did not align with my taste and I did not enjoy. Additionally, I was disappointed that the system suggested movies I had already watched and disliked on multiple occasions. This lack of personalization and repetition made me lose interest in the system. Overall, while the system had some good recommendations, it failed to consistently provide me with movies that strictly aligned with my taste, resulting in a mediocre experience.
