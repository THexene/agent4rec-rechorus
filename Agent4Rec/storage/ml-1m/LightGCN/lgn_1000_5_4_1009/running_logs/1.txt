RATING: 4
REASON: Although the recommender system provided some movie recommendations that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. The system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences when generating the recommendations. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations based on my preferences after the initial pages. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily satisfied with movie recommendations, and this system did not meet my expectations.
