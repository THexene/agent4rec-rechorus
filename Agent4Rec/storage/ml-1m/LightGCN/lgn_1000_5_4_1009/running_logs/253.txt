I dislike the rest movies: ['Faculty, The (1998)', "Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997)"].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 253, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and infrequent movie-watching habits. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, it also suggested movies that I disliked. Additionally, after browsing through three pages, the system did not provide any new recommendations based on my preferences. This lack of diversity in the recommendations was disappointing as a Cinematic Trailblazer. Overall, the system did not effectively cater to my unique movie preferences and failed to provide a satisfactory experience.
