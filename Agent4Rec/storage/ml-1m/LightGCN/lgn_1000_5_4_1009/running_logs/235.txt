        Act as user 235, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my specific movie preferences for suspenseful and horror movies, science fiction and fantasy movies, classic and cult films, comedy and light-hearted films, and drama and romance movies, the system failed to consistently recommend movies that aligned with my tastes. I found myself disliking the majority of the recommended movies and only enjoying a few. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed dislike for. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I expect the recommender system to understand my preferences and provide more accurate and tailored recommendations. Unfortunately, this system fell short in meeting my expectations.
