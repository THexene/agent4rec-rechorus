        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. Additionally, it did not provide any new recommendations after a few pages, which was disappointing. As an Occasional Viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and diverse selection of movies that would cater to my specific tastes. The system's inability to provide fresh and satisfying recommendations ultimately led to my dissatisfaction.
