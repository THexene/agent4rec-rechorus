        Act as user 104, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my preferred genres, the recommendations did not align with my taste at all. I only enjoyed and rated a few movies out of the ones suggested to me, and the majority of the recommendations were movies that I disliked. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my preferences and failed to provide me with suitable movie suggestions. As an occasional viewer who is highly selective about the movies I watch, I expected the recommender system to cater to my specific tastes, but it fell short in this regard. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the diversity of the recommendations and did not allow for any independent opinions. Overall, I was disappointed with the recommender system's inability to meet my expectations and provide me with satisfying movie recommendations.
