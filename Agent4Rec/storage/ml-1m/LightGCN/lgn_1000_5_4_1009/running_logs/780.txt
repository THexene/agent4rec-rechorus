        Act as user 780, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to understand my movie preferences and consistently recommended movies that I disliked. Despite providing feedback by rating the movies I watched, the system did not seem to adapt or improve its recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for a recommender system to accurately understand my tastes. However, this system repeatedly suggested movies that did not align with my preferred genres and styles. Additionally, the system did not take into account my conformity trait, as it continued to recommend movies with high historical ratings that I did not enjoy. Overall, this lack of personalization and failure to adapt to my preferences left me unsatisfied with the recommender system.
