        Relevant context from user 519's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Peeping Tom (1960), Christine (1983), Amadeus (1984), Rocky Horror Picture Show, The (1975), among them, I watched ['Peeping Tom (1960)', 'Amadeus (1984)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Christine (1983)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Psycho (1960), Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983), Nightmare on Elm Street, A (1984), North by Northwest (1959), among them, I watched ['Psycho (1960)', 'Nightmare on Elm Street, A (1984)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Nightmare on Elm Street, A (1984)', 'Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations.
        Act as user 519, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, and it did not provide any new recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and it is disappointing when the system fails to understand my preferences. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and seemed to ignore my feedback. I was hoping for more personalized and diverse recommendations, but the system fell short in delivering that.
