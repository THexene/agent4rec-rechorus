RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not align with my movie preferences and did not provide me with satisfactory recommendations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the system recommended movies that I did not enjoy, such as Babe, Witness, Raising Arizona, and Schindler's List. These movies did not match my preferences for thrilling and suspenseful movies, comedies, historical and period dramas, or thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating movies. Additionally, the system did not take into account my diversity trait as a Cinematic Trailblazer, as it did not recommend any unique or obscure movies that I might have been interested in. Overall, the recommendations provided by this system did not meet my expectations and did not cater to my specific movie preferences.
