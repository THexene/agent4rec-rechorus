 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: While the recommender system did provide me with some movies that aligned with my preferences, I was unsatisfied with the overall recommendations. The system recommended movies that I had already expressed dislike for, such as "Groundhog Day" and "Schindler's List". This indicates that the system did not fully understand my preferences and failed to take into account my previous ratings. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its recommendations, as it mostly suggested movies from genres that I typically enjoy. As an elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for more diverse and unexpected recommendations that could potentially pique my interest. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 3.
