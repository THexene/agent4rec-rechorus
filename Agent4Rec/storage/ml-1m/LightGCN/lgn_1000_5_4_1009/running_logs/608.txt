Relevant context from your memory:
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Clue (1985), Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), Angels in the Outfield (1994), Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999), among them, I watched ['Clue (1985)', 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)', 'Angels in the Outfield (1994)'].

POSITIVE: I enjoyed watching "Clue (1985)" and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)" and rated them highly. The recommender system did a good job suggesting these movies to me.

Level of fatigue: I am an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, so I may become tired more easily.

Decision: [EXIT]; Reason: I am an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, and I have already watched and rated the movies recommended on page 1. I am satisfied with my movie choices so far, and I don't feel the need to continue browsing.

        Relevant context from user 608's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Clue (1985), Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), Angels in the Outfield (1994), Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999), among them, I watched ['Clue (1985)', 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)', 'Angels in the Outfield (1994)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 608, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended a couple of movies that I enjoyed, the majority of the suggestions did not align with my tastes. I am an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, and the system failed to understand my unique preferences and the diversity of movies I seek. Additionally, the conformity trait of the system, which relies heavily on historical ratings, did not resonate with my maverick critic approach. I prefer to evaluate movies solely based on my own taste rather than relying on popular opinion. Overall, the system did not cater to my cinematic trailblazer nature and did not provide enough diverse and avant-garde movie choices.
