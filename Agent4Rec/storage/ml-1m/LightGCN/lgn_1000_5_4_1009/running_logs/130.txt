        Act as user 130, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to understand my movie preferences and consistently recommended movies that I disliked. Despite providing feedback by rating the movies I watched, the system did not seem to take my preferences into account. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately suggest movies that align with my tastes. Unfortunately, this system did not meet my expectations and left me unsatisfied.
