        Relevant context from user 784's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, My Cousin Vinny, Analyze This, Waterboy, The, among them, I watched ['Ace Ventura: Pet Detective', 'Analyze This'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Analyze This', 'My Cousin Vinny'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Bowfinger, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, Fly Away Home, Cool Runnings, among them, I watched ['Bowfinger', 'Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls', 'Fly Away Home', 'Cool Runnings'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them to me.
        Act as user 784, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my clear dislike for certain movies, the system continued to recommend them to me. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and the system failed to take that into account. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I do not rely on historical ratings and expect the system to understand and respect my unique taste. The lack of personalization and consideration for my preferences greatly impacted my satisfaction with the system.
