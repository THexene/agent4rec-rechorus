RATING: 8
REASON: I would rate this recommender system an 8 because it successfully recommended movies that aligned with my movie tastes and preferences. The system took into account my love for classic movies with humor, thought-provoking science fiction films, adventure and action-packed movies, heartwarming and feel-good movies, as well as crime dramas with intense storytelling. It also considered my occasional exploration of different genres. The recommendations on each page were mostly movies that I enjoyed and rated highly, and I appreciated that the system did not recommend movies that I had previously disliked. However, I deducted a few points because the system did not offer a wide variety of movies outside of my preferred genres. Overall, I am satisfied with the recommender system's performance.
