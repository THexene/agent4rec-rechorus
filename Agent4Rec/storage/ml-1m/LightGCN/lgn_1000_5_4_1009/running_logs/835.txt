        Relevant context from user 835's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Groundhog Day, American Beauty, Sleepless in Seattle, Forrest Gump, among them, I watched ['Groundhog Day'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['American Beauty', 'Sleepless in Seattle'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Notting Hill, As Good As It Gets, Wedding Singer, The, Titanic, among them, I watched ['Notting Hill'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['As Good As It Gets', 'Wedding Singer, The', 'Titanic'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I disliked on both pages.
        Act as user 835, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my incredibly infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to provide me with recommendations that aligned with my preferences. It recommended movies that I explicitly disliked on both pages, which shows a lack of understanding of my taste. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous rating of '4' for the movie 'Groundhog Day' and continued to suggest similar movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with personalized and relevant recommendations.
