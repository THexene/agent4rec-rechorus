        Relevant context from user 788's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: L.A. Confidential, Grosse Pointe Blank, Lethal Weapon, Tombstone, among them, I watched ['L.A.

        Act as user 788, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 out of 10. While it did recommend a few movies that aligned with my taste, the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I do expect the system to understand my preferences and suggest movies that I would enjoy. However, this system failed to consistently recommend movies that aligned with my taste. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences left me unsatisfied with the overall experience.
