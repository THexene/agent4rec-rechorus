        Act as user 941, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did suggest some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Annie Hall" and "Singin' in the Rain," it also recommended movies that I disliked on multiple occasions, such as "Amadeus" and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." This inconsistency in the recommendations made me feel unsatisfied with the system. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits, as it continued to suggest movies even after I expressed my dissatisfaction. Overall, I would rate this recommender system a 4 because it did not consistently provide recommendations that matched my preferences and did not adapt to my activity trait.
