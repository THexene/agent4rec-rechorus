- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Sleepless in Seattle (1993), Great Expectations (1998), Sabrina (1995), Broadcast News (1987), among them, I watched ['Sleepless in Seattle (1993)', 'Great Expectations (1998)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Broadcast News (1987)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 610, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and watch movies infrequently. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer any variety or new suggestions that could potentially pique my interest. I was hoping for a more personalized and diverse selection of movies that align with my taste in romantic comedies, thought-provoking dramas, classic movies, historical and epic films, and artistic and visually stunning films. Unfortunately, this system fell short in meeting my expectations.
