MOVIE: Matrix, The (1999); ALIGN: Yes; REASON: This movie aligns with my taste as it falls under the genres of sci-fi and thriller, which I enjoy. The summary also sounds intriguing with its concept of a computer hacker discovering the truth about reality and joining a rebellion against machines.

- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them to me.
        Act as user 236, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not take into account my dislike for certain movies. Despite rating movies that I watched and enjoyed, the system continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and it is important for the recommender system to consider my dislikes as well. Additionally, as a dedicated follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not seem to take that into account either. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not understand my movie preferences adequately.
