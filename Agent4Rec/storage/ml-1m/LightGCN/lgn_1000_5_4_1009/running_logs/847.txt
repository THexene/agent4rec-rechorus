RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my preferences, it failed to provide me with new and diverse movie options. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which indicates a lack of understanding of my unique tastes and preferences. Additionally, the system did not take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits, as it continued to suggest movies even after I had already watched and rated some. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
