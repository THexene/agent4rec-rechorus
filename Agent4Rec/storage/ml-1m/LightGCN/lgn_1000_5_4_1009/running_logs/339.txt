I dislike the rest movies: ['North by Northwest (1959)', 'Beetlejuice (1988)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them.

        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and watch movies infrequently. The system failed to take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them to me. This lack of personalization and consideration for my preferences left me unsatisfied. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it repeatedly suggested movies from genres that I have already indicated a preference for. Overall, the system did not adequately cater to my selective viewing habits and failed to provide recommendations that aligned with my taste.
