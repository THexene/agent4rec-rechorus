        Relevant context from user 577's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Schindler's List, Annie Hall, North by Northwest, Godfather, The, among them, I watched ["Schindler's List", 'Godfather, The'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively.

I dislike the rest movies: ['E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 577, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and do not watch movies frequently. The system failed to take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits and recommended movies that I had already seen and disliked. Additionally, as a dedicated follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. However, the system did not seem to consider this and continued to recommend movies that did not align with my usual taste. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not meet my needs as a user with specific preferences and viewing habits.
