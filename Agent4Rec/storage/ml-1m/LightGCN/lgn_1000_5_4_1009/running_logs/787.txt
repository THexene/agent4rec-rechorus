        Relevant context from user 787's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Notting Hill, Broadcast News, Sleepless in Seattle, Emma, among them, I watched ['Notting Hill', 'Sleepless in Seattle'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively.

- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations.
        Act as user 787, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, this recommender system failed to provide me with any new recommendations beyond the first two pages. It suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, which left me feeling unsatisfied. Additionally, the system did not take into account my preference for unique and unconventional movies, as it mainly recommended popular romantic comedies. Overall, the lack of variety and inability to cater to my specific taste left me disappointed with this recommender system.
