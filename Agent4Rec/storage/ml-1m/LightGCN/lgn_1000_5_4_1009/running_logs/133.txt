        Act as user 133, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, it also recommended a significant number of movies that I disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. I appreciate action-packed, sci-fi and fantasy films, as well as classic and iconic movies. I also enjoy thrilling and suspenseful movies, as well as adventure and historical films. However, this recommender system failed to consistently recommend movies that fit within these preferences. It relied heavily on historical ratings, which may not always align with my personal taste. Additionally, the system did not take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits, which means that I have limited opportunities to explore and discover new movies. Overall, while the recommender system had some hits, it also had a significant number of misses, leading to my dissatisfaction.
