Despite this, the system recommended movies that did not align with my Sci-Fi Enthusiast, Classic Film Lover, Thriller Fan, Legal Drama Enthusiast, and Mystery Lover preferences. It did not take into account my selectivity and curated choices, which left me unsatisfied with the recommendations. Additionally, the system did not consider my ratings and preferences, as it continued to suggest movies that I had already disliked. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide accurate recommendations, resulting in a low rating of 3.
