RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system had some hits and misses. I appreciated that it recommended movies that aligned with my taste, such as "The Sixth Sense" and "Shawshank Redemption," which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, it also suggested movies like "Being John Malkovich" and "Silence of the Lambs," which I did not like. On the positive side, the system did recommend some diverse options like "Schindler's List" and "Princess Bride," which I ended up enjoying. However, it failed to provide any new recommendations on the third page, which was disappointing. Overall, the system had its moments of success but also had some shortcomings, leading me to rate it a 6.
