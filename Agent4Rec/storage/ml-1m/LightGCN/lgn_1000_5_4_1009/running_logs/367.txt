I dislike the rest movies: ['Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them.
        Act as user 367, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences, and it is important for a recommender system to respect and understand that. However, this system seemed to overlook my feedback and continued to suggest movies that did not align with my preferences. This lack of personalization and consideration for my dislikes left me unsatisfied with the overall experience.
