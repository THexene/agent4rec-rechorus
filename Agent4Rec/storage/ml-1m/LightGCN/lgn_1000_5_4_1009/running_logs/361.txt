As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and infrequent movie-watching habits. However, the recommender system failed to take this into account and recommended movies that did not align with my preferences. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I do not rely on historical ratings and evaluate movies solely based on my own taste. The system's reliance on historical ratings did not provide accurate recommendations for me. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not understand my unique movie preferences.
