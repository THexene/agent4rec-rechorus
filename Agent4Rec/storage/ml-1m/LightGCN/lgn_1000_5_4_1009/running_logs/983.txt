        Relevant context from user 983's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Fargo (1996), Shawshank Redemption, The (1994), American Beauty (1999), Being John Malkovich (1999), among them, I watched ['Fargo (1996)', 'Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively.

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Schindler's List (1993), English Patient, The (1996), Three Kings (1999), Sliding Doors (1998), among them, I watched ["Schindler's List (1993)"] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['English Patient, The (1996)', 'Three Kings (1999)', 'Sliding Doors (1998)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately predict my movie preferences and I disliked most of the recommended movies.
        Act as user 983, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not accurately predict my movie preferences and I disliked most of the recommended movies. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. I enjoy intense and suspenseful movies, thought-provoking and emotionally impactful films, character-driven dramas, movies with a mix of comedy and drama, unique and unconventional storytelling styles, and movies that explore different cultures and societal issues. However, the recommender system failed to understand these preferences and recommended movies that did not align with my taste at all. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and completely ignore historical ratings. The system's reliance on historical ratings did not provide accurate recommendations for me. Furthermore, as an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I expect a high level of curation and exclusivity in the movie choices. The recommender system did not meet this expectation and failed to provide me with a curated list of movies that matched my taste. Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system and its inability to accurately predict and cater to my movie preferences.
