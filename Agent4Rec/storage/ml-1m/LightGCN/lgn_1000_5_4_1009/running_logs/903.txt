POSITIVE: I enjoyed watching "Big Lebowski, The" and "American Beauty" and rated them highly. It's always a great feeling when the recommender system suggests movies that I end up loving.

Level of fatigue: Very tired. I've already browsed through four pages of recommendations and it's starting to take a toll on me.

Decision: [EXIT]; Reason: I am both tired and unsatisfied with some of the movies that were recommended to me. It's time to take a break from the recommender system and maybe explore other movie sources for a while.

RATING: 4
REASON: While I appreciate the effort of the recommender system in providing movie recommendations, I am not entirely satisfied with the results. Although I am a movie enthusiast with a diverse taste, I found that the majority of the recommended movies did not align with my preferences. I enjoyed a few movies that were recommended, but overall, the system failed to consistently suggest movies that catered to my specific interests. Additionally, the system seemed to overlook my dislike for certain genres and continued to recommend movies from those genres. As a result, I was left feeling disappointed with the recommendations and ultimately decided to exit the recommender system after browsing four pages.
