RATING: 2
REASON: I am extremely unsatisfied with the recommender system. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and rarely watch movies. However, the recommender system failed to understand my preferences and repeatedly suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding and consideration for my unique movie-watching habits. Additionally, the system did not take into account my Maverick Critic trait, as it relied heavily on historical ratings instead of evaluating movies based on my own taste. Lastly, the system did not provide any variety or options that aligned with my diverse movie tastes. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide relevant and personalized recommendations.
