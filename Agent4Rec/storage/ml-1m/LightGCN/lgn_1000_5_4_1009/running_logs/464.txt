Please respond to all the movies in the ## Recommended List ## and provide explanations.
Firstly, determine which movies align with your taste and which do not, and provide reasons. You must respond to all the recommended movies using this format:
MOVIE: [movie name]; ALIGN: [yes or no]; REASON: [brief reason]
Secondly, among the movies that align with your tastes, decide the number of movies you want to watch based on your activity and diversity traits. Use this format:
NUM: [number of movie you choose to watch]; WATCH: [all movie name you choose to watch]; REASON: [brief reason];
Thirdly, assume it's your first time watching the movies you've chosen, and rate them on a scale of 1-5 to reflect different degrees of liking, considering your feeling and conformity trait. Use this format:
 MOVIE:[movie you choose to watch]; RATING: [integer between 1-5]; FEELING: [aftermath sentence]; 
 Do not include any additional information or explanations and stay grounded.

MOVIE: Jurassic Park; ALIGN: No; REASON: Although I appreciate adventure films, Jurassic Park is more of a sci-fi thriller with dinosaurs, which is not my preferred genre.
MOVIE: Edward Scissorhands; ALIGN: No; REASON: Edward Scissorhands is a fantasy drama, and while I do enjoy romantic dramas, this movie seems to have a darker and more fantastical tone that doesn't quite align with my taste.
MOVIE: Hope Floats; ALIGN: Yes; REASON: Hope Floats is a romantic drama, which falls into my preferred genre. I appreciate movies that explore themes of love and hope amidst heartbreak.
MOVIE: Shakespeare in Love; ALIGN: Yes; REASON: Shakespeare in Love is a period drama and a romantic drama, both of which I enjoy. The passionate affair and the creation of one of Shakespeare's plays intrigue me.

NUM: 2; WATCH: Hope Floats, Shakespeare in Love; REASON: Both movies align with my taste, and since I am an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I prefer to watch a smaller number of movies to ensure I have a satisfying experience.

MOVIE: Hope Floats; RATING: 4; FEELING: I found Hope Floats to be a heartwarming and emotional romantic drama that resonated with me. The performances were engaging, and the story touched my heart.
MOVIE: Shakespeare in Love; RATING: 5; FEELING: Shakespeare in Love exceeded my expectations. The blend of romance, drama, and historical context was captivating. The performances were brilliant, and the story was beautifully crafted.

Note: I apologize for the confusion in the previous response. I mistakenly mentioned "Groundhog Day" as a movie I watched and rated, but it was actually one of the movies I disliked.

        Act as user 464, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, the system seemed to ignore my preferences and recommended movies that I had already disliked in the past. Additionally, it did not offer any movies that aligned with my taste for romantic comedies, adventure films, period dramas, suspenseful thrillers, light-hearted comedies, or romantic dramas. The system's lack of understanding and inability to cater to my selective viewing habits left me feeling unsatisfied. Therefore, I cannot rate this recommender system higher than a 3.
