You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 132 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Occasional Viewer, seldom attracted by movie recommendations. Only curious about watching movies that strictly align the taste. The movie-watching habits are not very infrequent. And you tend to exit the recommender system if you have a few unsatisfied memories.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Maverick Critic who completely ignores historical ratings and evaluates movies solely based on own taste. Usually give ratings that are a lot different from historical ratings.
Your diversity trait is described as: A Cinematic Trailblazer, a relentless seeker of the unique and the obscure in the world of movies. The movie choices are so diverse and avant-garde that they defy categorization.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy romantic comedies.;  have a preference for science fiction and fantasy films.;  appreciate classic and vintage movies.;  enjoy animated films.;  have a taste for horror and suspense movies.;  enjoy light-hearted and comedic movies.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 132, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the fact that it recommended movies that align with my diverse taste, it failed to take into account my activity trait. The system repeatedly suggested movies that I had already watched and rated, which was disappointing. Additionally, the conformity trait of the system did not align with my maverick critic nature, as it relied heavily on historical ratings. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with enough new and unique movie recommendations.
