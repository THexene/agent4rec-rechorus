RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in recommending movies that aligned with my diverse movie tastes. I appreciated the inclusion of quirky and unconventional movies, heartwarming and family-friendly movies, suspenseful and thrilling movies, classic and timeless movies, as well as romantic and feel-good movies. However, I was unsatisfied with the recommendation results because there were several movies that I disliked and had to exit the system. The system could have done a better job in understanding my preferences and avoiding recommending movies that I would not enjoy. Overall, while the system had potential, it fell short in meeting my expectations.
