        Relevant context from user 229's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Ghostbusters (1984), 13th Warrior, The (1999), Bone Collector, The (1999), Thing, The (1982), among them, I watched ['Ghostbusters (1984)', 'Bone Collector, The (1999)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['13th Warrior, The (1999)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Shining, The (1980), Jacob's Ladder (1990), Sixth Sense, The (1999), Alien: Resurrection (1997), among them, I watched ['Shining, The (1980)', 'Sixth Sense, The (1999)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ["Jacob's Ladder (1990)", 'Alien: Resurrection (1997)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not provide any new movies that I haven't watched or disliked.
        Act as user 229, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 out of 10. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it failed to provide any new movies that I haven't watched or disliked. As an occasional viewer, I rely on the recommender system to introduce me to new movies that I might enjoy. However, this system seemed to only suggest movies that I had already seen or explicitly disliked. This lack of variety and exploration left me unsatisfied with the recommendations. Additionally, the system did not take into account my preference for thrilling and suspenseful, action-packed and adventurous, romantic and dramatic, comedy and light-hearted, and intense and gripping movies. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not effectively cater to my movie preferences.
