        Act as user 458, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: Although I appreciate the effort of the recommender system in providing movie recommendations, I am not satisfied with the results. The system recommended movies that did not align with my preferences, and I ended up disliking most of the movies I watched. As a Movie Enthusiast, I have an insatiable appetite for films, but the recommender system failed to understand my diverse taste and instead suggested movies that were not to my liking. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the variety of movies recommended to me. I was hoping for a more personalized and accurate recommendation experience, but unfortunately, this system fell short.
