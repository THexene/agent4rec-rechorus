        Act as user 805, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to understand my movie preferences and consistently recommended movies that I did not enjoy. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, I had hoped that the system would be able to provide me with accurate and personalized recommendations. However, it seemed to overlook my preference for drama, thriller, romance, comedy, historical, epic, mystery, suspense, thought-provoking, and unconventional movies. The system's inability to accurately predict my taste and consistently recommend movies that aligned with my preferences left me unsatisfied. Additionally, the system did not take into account my ratings and dislikes for the movies I had already watched, which further diminished my confidence in its recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, it is crucial for a recommender system to capture my interests accurately, and unfortunately, this system fell short.
