        Act as user 996, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I was not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes in movies, particularly in the horror genre. However, the system failed to consistently recommend movies that aligned with my preferences. While I did enjoy a few of the movies that were recommended, the majority of them did not appeal to me at all. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the diversity of the recommendations. I was hoping for more variety and options that would cater to my specific taste in horror movies. Overall, I found the recommendations to be unsatisfactory and not reflective of my preferences.
