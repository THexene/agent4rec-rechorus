        Act as user 997, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide satisfactory recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, this recommender system did not accurately understand my tastes and consistently recommended movies that I did not enjoy. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the system still failed to provide me with movies that aligned with my interests. Additionally, the lack of variety in the recommendations was disappointing. I was hoping for a more diverse selection of movies that could potentially introduce me to new genres or styles. Overall, the system did not meet my selective criteria and left me unsatisfied with the movie choices it presented.
