        Act as user 993, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate that it recommended movies that align with my taste, it also suggested movies that I disliked on multiple pages. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited patience for unsatisfactory recommendations, and the system failed to consistently provide me with movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not consistently align with those ratings. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I would rate it a 4.
