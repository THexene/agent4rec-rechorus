 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend a few movies that I enjoyed, the majority of the recommendations were not aligned with my preferences. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommendations to be highly accurate. However, this system failed to consistently suggest movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, as a Balanced Evaluator, I consider both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings. The system's recommendations did not always align with the historical ratings, which made it difficult for me to trust its suggestions. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I left feeling unsatisfied.
