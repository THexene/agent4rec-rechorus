RATING: 7; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 7. The system has provided me with a good mix of movies that align with my movie tastes, such as the Star Wars series and Fargo. It also introduced me to some new movies that I ended up enjoying, like Monty Python and the Holy Grail. However, there were instances where the system recommended movies that I didn't like, such as Mad Max and Untouchables. Additionally, after a few pages of recommendations, the system started suggesting movies that I had already watched and rated, which was a bit disappointing. Overall, the recommender system has been helpful in discovering new movies, but there is room for improvement in terms of avoiding movies I dislike and providing more diverse recommendations.
