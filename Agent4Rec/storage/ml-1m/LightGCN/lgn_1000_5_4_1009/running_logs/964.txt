        Act as user 964, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am highly unsatisfied with the recommendations it provided. Despite my diverse movie tastes and occasional exploration of different genres, the system failed to offer me any new or interesting movies. It repeatedly suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I rely heavily on recommendations to guide my movie choices, but this system did not meet my expectations. Additionally, the system did not take into account my conformity trait, as it did not provide recommendations based on historical ratings. Overall, the system did not cater to my unique preferences and failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations.
