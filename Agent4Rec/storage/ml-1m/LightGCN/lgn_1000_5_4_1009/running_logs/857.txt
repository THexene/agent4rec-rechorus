RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that align with my taste, which includes intense and thrilling movies, strong character development and emotional depth, humor and wit, and thought-provoking and critically acclaimed movies. However, the system recommended movies that did not align with my preferences, resulting in me disliking the majority of the movies suggested. Additionally, the system did not take into account my dislike for certain movies, which further decreased my satisfaction. Therefore, I am not satisfied with this recommender system.
