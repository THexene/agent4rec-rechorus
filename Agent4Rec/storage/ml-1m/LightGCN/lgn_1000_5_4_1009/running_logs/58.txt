        Act as user 58, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not align well with my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the system recommended several movies that I disliked, such as Seven (Se7en), Mask of Zorro, The, So I Married an Axe Murderer, Tomorrow Never Dies, Crow, The, Con Air, Batman Forever, and There's Something About Mary. These movies are not within my preferred genres of action-packed thrillers, sci-fi comedies, adventure and historical dramas, crime and mystery thrillers, or cult classics and independent films. The system did recommend a few movies that I enjoyed, such as Saving Private Ryan, Lethal Weapon 4, True Lies, and Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, but the majority of the recommendations were not satisfactory. As a result, I am not satisfied with this recommender system and would not rely on it for future movie suggestions.
