        Relevant context from user 697's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Silence of the Lambs, The (1991), Forrest Gump (1994), L.A. Confidential (1997), Pulp Fiction (1994), among them, I watched ['Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)', 'L.A. Confidential (1997)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Forrest Gump (1994)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 697, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did suggest a couple of movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Silence of the Lambs" and "L.A. Confidential," I was not satisfied with the overall recommendations. The inclusion of "Forrest Gump" was a disappointment as it does not fall within my preferred genres. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety or options for me to explore. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and diverse selection of movies that would pique my interest. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 4.
