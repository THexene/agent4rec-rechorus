        Act as user 734, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and infrequent movie-watching habits. While I appreciate the system's attempt to consider both historical ratings and personal preferences, it still recommended movies that I disliked multiple times. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations after browsing through four pages, which was disappointing. As a Cinematic Trailblazer, I was hoping for more diverse and avant-garde movie choices, but the system seemed to stick to more mainstream options. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not cater to my unique movie preferences.
