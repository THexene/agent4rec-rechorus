Please respond to all the movies in the ## Recommended List ## and provide explanations.
Firstly, determine which movies align with your taste and which do not, and provide reasons. You must respond to all the recommended movies using this format:
MOVIE: [movie name]; ALIGN: [yes or no]; REASON: [brief reason]
Secondly, among the movies that align with your tastes, decide the number of movies you want to watch based on your activity and diversity traits. Use this format:

MOVIE: Airplane!; ALIGN: Yes; REASON: I enjoy comedy films and this movie seems like a hilarious disaster spoof, which aligns with my taste.

        Relevant context from user 602's memory:

        Act as user 602, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I did find a couple of movies that I enjoyed, the majority of the recommendations did not align with my taste. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and the system failed to understand that. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I don't rely on historical ratings, so the system's reliance on them did not provide me with accurate recommendations. The lack of diversity in the recommendations also contributed to my dissatisfaction. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I would rate it a 3.
