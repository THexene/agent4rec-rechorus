RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate that it recommended movies that align with my taste, the majority of the recommended movies did not appeal to me. I only found one movie that I enjoyed and rated highly. The system did not provide enough variety or options that matched my preferences, leading to a lack of satisfaction. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide a satisfactory movie selection.
