        Act as user 521, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to provide me with any movies that I liked or was interested in. Despite browsing through four pages of recommendations, none of the movies aligned with my taste for action-packed thrillers, classic dramas, comedy classics, adventure and fantasy, romantic dramas, or sports-themed movies. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only curious about watching movies that strictly align with my taste, and this recommender system did not meet that expectation. Additionally, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate seeking out unique and obscure movies, but this system did not offer any such options. Overall, the lack of satisfaction and relevance in the recommendations led to a low rating.
