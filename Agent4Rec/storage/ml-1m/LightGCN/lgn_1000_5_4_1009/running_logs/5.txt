        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as GoodFellas and Pulp Fiction, the majority of the recommendations did not appeal to me. I appreciate dark and gritty films, clever and mind-bending movies, and dark comedies, but the system recommended movies like Saving Private Ryan and Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, which are not in line with my preferences. Additionally, the system did not take into account my dislike for certain genres, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. Overall, the system did not provide me with a personalized and tailored movie selection, leading to my dissatisfaction and decision to exit the recommender system.
