MOVIE: U.S. Marshalls; ALIGN: No; REASON: U.S. Marshalls does not align with my taste as it is more of a crime/action movie rather than a thriller.
MOVIE: Outbreak; ALIGN: No; REASON: Outbreak is a medical thriller, which is not my preferred genre.

        Relevant context from user 647's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Die Hard 2, Rock, The, U.S. Marshalls, Outbreak, among them, I watched ['Die Hard 2', 'Rock, The'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Rock, The', 'U.S. Marshalls', 'Outbreak'].

- Turn to page 3 of the recommendation.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 3: Negotiator, The, Eraser, Rush Hour, Lethal Weapon 4, among them, I watched ['Negotiator, The', 'Eraser', 'Rush Hour'] and rate them ['4', '3', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Eraser', 'Lethal Weapon 4'].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 647, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and patience for exploring movie recommendations, and the fact that the system failed to provide me with fresh and suitable options on multiple occasions was disappointing. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I rely heavily on my own taste rather than historical ratings, so the system's reliance on those ratings did not resonate with me. Lastly, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I expect a high level of curation and exclusivity in the movies recommended to me, and the system's lack of understanding in this regard further contributed to my dissatisfaction. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide a satisfactory movie selection.
