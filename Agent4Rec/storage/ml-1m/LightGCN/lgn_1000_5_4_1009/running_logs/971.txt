        Act as user 971, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system had some hits and misses. While it recommended a few movies that aligned with my taste, there were also several movies that I disliked. The system did not consistently understand my preferences, and I had to browse through multiple pages to find movies that I enjoyed. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the diversity of recommendations. Overall, the system had potential but needs improvement in understanding my unique taste and providing more diverse suggestions.
