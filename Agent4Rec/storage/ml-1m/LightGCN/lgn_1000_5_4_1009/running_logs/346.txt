- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 3: Exorcist, The (1973), Rosemary's Baby (1968), Devil's Advocate, The (1997), Idle Hands (1999), among them, I watched ['Exorcist, The (1973)', "Rosemary's Baby (1968)"] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ["Devil's Advocate, The (1997)", 'Idle Hands (1999)'].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 346, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to consistently recommend movies that align with my taste. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences for horror, thriller, drama, and classic movies. However, the system recommended movies that I disliked multiple times, such as "Hellraiser: Bloodline" and "Species". It did suggest a few movies that I enjoyed, like "Army of Darkness" and "Scream", but the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. Additionally, the system did not take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits, as it continued to recommend movies even after I expressed dissatisfaction. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide a satisfactory movie selection for me.
