RATING: 3

While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, such as "You've Got Mail" and "Toy Story," the majority of the recommendations did not appeal to me. I found myself disliking most of the movies suggested on each page, which made me unsatisfied with the overall experience.

The system failed to consistently provide me with movies that I would enjoy, and therefore, I cannot rate it higher than a 3.
