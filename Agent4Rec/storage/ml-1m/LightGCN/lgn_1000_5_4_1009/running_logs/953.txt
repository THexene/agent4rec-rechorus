        Act as user 953, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did provide me with some movies that aligned with my preferences, I was unsatisfied with the overall recommendations. The system recommended movies that I disliked, and even though I found a few movies that I enjoyed, it was not enough to compensate for the dissatisfaction. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its recommendations, sticking mostly to popular and well-known movies. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I was hoping for more unique and unconventional suggestions. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and left me wanting more.
