RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system had some positive aspects, such as recommending movies that aligned with my preferred genres of comedy, adventure, fantasy, action, drama, and historical events. I appreciated that it took into account both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving recommendations. However, I was not completely satisfied with the system. The recommendations on page 2 did not match my taste, and there was not enough variety in the recommendations overall. Additionally, the system did not seem to learn from my dislikes, as it continued to suggest movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. Overall, while the system had some good features, it could be improved to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations.
