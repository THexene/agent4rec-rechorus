- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 495, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, the system consistently recommended movies that did not align with my preferences, resulting in a high number of dislikes. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the system still failed to accurately predict my movie preferences. Additionally, the lack of variety in the recommendations was disappointing, as it did not offer any new or unexpected movie choices. Overall, the recommender system did not effectively cater to my selective and infrequent movie-watching habits, leading to my dissatisfaction and decision to exit the system.
