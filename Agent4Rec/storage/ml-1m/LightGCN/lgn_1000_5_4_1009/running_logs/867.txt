        Relevant context from user 867's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Moonstruck, Witness, Amadeus, Ordinary People, among them, I watched ['Moonstruck'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Witness', 'Amadeus'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Annie Hall, GoodFellas, Apocalypse Now, My Left Foot, among them, I watched ['Annie Hall'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['GoodFellas', 'Apocalypse Now'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I disliked on both page 1 and page 2.
        Act as user 867, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to understand my movie preferences and consistently recommended movies that I disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and the system did not take that into account. Despite being a balanced evaluator, considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the system did not provide me with any movies that aligned with my preferences for historical and dramatic themes, exploration of human relationships and emotions, nostalgia, strong female characters, and foreign and artistic touches. The lack of variety in the recommendations also did not cater to my exceedingly discerning selective viewer trait. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I am unsatisfied with the results.
