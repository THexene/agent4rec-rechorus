I dislike the rest movies: ['Strictly Ballroom (1992)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the system did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them to me.
        Act as user 879, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations and left me unsatisfied. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and watch movies infrequently. However, the system did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them to me. This lack of personalization and consideration for my preferences made me feel frustrated and uninterested in exploring further recommendations. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it kept suggesting movies that were similar to the ones I had already watched and rated positively. Overall, the system failed to understand my unique movie tastes and did not provide a satisfactory user experience.
