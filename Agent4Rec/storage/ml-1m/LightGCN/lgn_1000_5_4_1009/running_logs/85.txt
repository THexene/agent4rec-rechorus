        Act as user 85, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system provided some movie recommendations that aligned with my taste, such as "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" and "Matrix, The". I enjoyed watching these movies and gave them high ratings. However, there were also some recommendations that did not appeal to me, such as "Men in Black" and "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace". I would have preferred if the recommender system had a better understanding of my specific preferences and avoided suggesting movies that I am unlikely to enjoy. Additionally, the recommender system did not provide any new movie recommendations after page 3, which was disappointing. Overall, while the system had some hits, it also had some misses and could have been more tailored to my taste. Hence, I rate it a 6.
