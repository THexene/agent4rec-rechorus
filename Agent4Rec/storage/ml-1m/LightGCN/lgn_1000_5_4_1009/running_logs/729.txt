        Act as user 729, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it failed to provide any new movie recommendations after a few pages. As an occasional viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I was curious to explore movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the system kept suggesting movies that I had already watched and disliked, which was disappointing. Additionally, the lack of diversity in the recommendations made me lose interest in continuing to use the system. I believe the system could benefit from improving its ability to suggest new and diverse movies that align with my preferences.
