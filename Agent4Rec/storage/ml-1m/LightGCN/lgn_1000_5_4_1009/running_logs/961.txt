        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily swayed by movie recommendations and only watch movies that strictly align with my taste. However, this system recommended movies that I did not enjoy on multiple occasions, which led to my dissatisfaction. Additionally, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate diversity in movie choices, but the system did not consistently provide me with unique and obscure movies. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and failed to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy.
