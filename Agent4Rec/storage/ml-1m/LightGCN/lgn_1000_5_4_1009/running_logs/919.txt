        Relevant context from user 919's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Secrets & Lies, Schindler's List, Amadeus, Annie Hall, among them, I watched ['Secrets & Lies'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ["Schindler's List", 'Amadeus', 'Annie Hall'].

- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 919, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, the system seemed to ignore my preferences and recommended movies that I had no interest in, such as "Schindler's List," "Amadeus," and "Annie Hall." These movies did not align with my preference for intense drama and psychological thrillers, classic movies with strong performances, or thought-provoking and emotionally impactful films. 

Furthermore, the system did not take into account my Maverick Critic trait, as it relied heavily on historical ratings to make recommendations. This resulted in a disconnect between my own taste and the ratings of others, leading to recommendations that I did not enjoy. 

Although I did find a few movies that I liked, such as "Secrets & Lies," "Straight Story, The," and "Rear Window," the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. As a Niche Explorer, I appreciate the occasional exploration of different genres, but the system failed to provide a good balance between my preferred movie types and new genres to explore. 

Overall, the system did not understand my unique movie preferences and did not provide recommendations that satisfied me as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer.
