        Relevant context from user 677's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Breakfast at Tiffany's, Sense and Sensibility, Casablanca, Philadelphia Story, The, among them, I watched ["Breakfast at Tiffany's", 'Sense and Sensibility'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Sense and Sensibility'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 677, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: Although the recommender system did suggest a couple of movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and "Sense and Sensibility," I was not entirely satisfied with the overall recommendations. The system failed to offer enough variety and diversity in its suggestions, which is important to me as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer. Additionally, the system did not take into account my preference for musicals and period films, which further contributed to my dissatisfaction. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 4.
