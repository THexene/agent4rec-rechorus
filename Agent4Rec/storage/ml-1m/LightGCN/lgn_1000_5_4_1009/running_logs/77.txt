        Relevant context from user 77's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Fargo (1996), Twelve Monkeys (1995), Godfather, The (1972), Saving Private Ryan (1998), among them, I watched ['Fargo (1996)', 'Twelve Monkeys (1995)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Godfather, The (1972)', 'Saving Private Ryan (1998)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 77, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: Although the recommender system did suggest a couple of movies that aligned with my taste, I was not completely satisfied with the overall recommendations. The system recommended movies like "Fargo" and "Twelve Monkeys" which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, it also suggested movies like "Godfather, The" and "Saving Private Ryan" which are not my preferred genres and I did not enjoy watching them. I appreciate that the system took into account my personal preferences, but I feel that it could have done a better job in understanding my specific taste for action-packed thrillers, sci-fi classics, dark and suspenseful dramas, quirky and offbeat films, and classic adventure movies. Additionally, the system could have provided more variety within these genres to cater to my selective viewing habits. Overall, I would rate this recommender system a 4 because it did not meet my expectations in terms of accurately recommending movies that I would enjoy.
