        Relevant context from user 161's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Bowfinger (1999), Sixth Sense, The (1999), Doctor Dolittle (1998), 13th Warrior, The (1999), among them, I watched ['Bowfinger (1999)', 'Sixth Sense, The (1999)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Doctor Dolittle (1998)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999), Ghostbusters (1984), General's Daughter, The (1999), Big Daddy (1999), among them, I watched ['South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)', 'Ghostbusters (1984)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ["General's Daughter, The (1999)", 'Big Daddy (1999)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new suggestions.
        Act as user 161, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new suggestions. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. I was hoping that the recommender system would understand my preferences and suggest movies that align with my interests. However, it failed to do so and instead recommended movies that I had already seen and disliked. This lack of personalization and inability to provide new and exciting suggestions greatly disappointed me. Additionally, as a dedicated follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. The fact that the recommender system did not take this into account and continued to recommend movies that did not align with my preferences further decreased my satisfaction with the system. Overall, I would rate this recommender system a 3 out of 10.
