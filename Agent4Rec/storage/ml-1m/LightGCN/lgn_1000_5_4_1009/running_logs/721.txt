        Relevant context from user 721's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Notorious (1946), Blade Runner (1982), Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), among them, I watched ['Notorious (1946)', 'Blade Runner (1982)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Run Silent, Run Deep (1958)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Manchurian Candidate, The (1962), African Queen, The (1951), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Chinatown (1974), among them, I watched ['Manchurian Candidate, The (1962)', 'Saving Private Ryan (1998)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['African Queen, The (1951)', 'Chinatown (1974)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them.
        Act as user 721, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and it is important for the recommender system to respect those preferences. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not seem to take that into consideration either. The lack of personalization and disregard for my expressed preferences left me unsatisfied with the recommendations.
