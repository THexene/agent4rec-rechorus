I dislike the rest movies: ['Fargo (1996)', 'Fugitive, The (1993)', 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the system did not accurately predict my movie preferences and recommended movies that I disliked.
        Act as user 770, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my diverse taste and preferences for classic, thought-provoking, epic, emotionally impactful, and suspenseful films, it failed to accurately predict my movie preferences. The system recommended movies that I disliked, and I had to browse through multiple pages to find movies that I actually enjoyed. Additionally, the system heavily relies on historical ratings, which limits the diversity of movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I expect the recommender system to understand my unique movie-watching habits and provide more tailored and accurate recommendations.
