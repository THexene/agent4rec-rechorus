        Act as user 374, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the effort in recommending movies based on my personal taste, the majority of the movies suggested to me did not align with my preferences. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my taste and provide suitable recommendations. However, the system failed to consistently suggest movies that I would enjoy, resulting in a high number of dislikes. Additionally, the system did not take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits, as it continued to recommend movies even after I expressed dissatisfaction. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not effectively cater to my selective viewing preferences.
