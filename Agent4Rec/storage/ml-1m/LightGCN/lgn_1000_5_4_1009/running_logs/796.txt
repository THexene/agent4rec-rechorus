RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system had some hits and misses. While I enjoyed a few of the recommended movies, there were also several movies that I disliked. The system did not consistently align with my taste, which was disappointing. However, I appreciate that it provided a diverse range of movie recommendations, including some unique and obscure choices. Overall, the system could be improved to better understand my preferences and avoid recommending movies that I am unlikely to enjoy.
