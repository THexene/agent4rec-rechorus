RATING: 7; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 7. While it did provide me with some enjoyable movie recommendations that aligned with my preferences, there were also instances where it suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations on certain pages, which was disappointing. However, I appreciate that the recommender system took into account my diverse movie tastes and provided a mix of genres. Overall, it was a decent experience, but there is room for improvement in terms of avoiding repetitive suggestions and providing more personalized recommendations.
