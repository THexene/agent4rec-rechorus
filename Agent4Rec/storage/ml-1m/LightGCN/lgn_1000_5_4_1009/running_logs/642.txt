- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because it recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new movies that I might be interested in.
        Act as user 642, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with any new movie recommendations that aligned with my unique and diverse taste. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a system that would surprise me with movies I had never heard of before. However, the system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which was disappointing. Additionally, the system did not take into account my preference for action-packed, classic, fantasy, emotional, and romantic movies, and instead seemed to rely solely on historical ratings. Overall, the system did not cater to my cinematic trailblazer nature and did not provide me with any satisfying recommendations.
