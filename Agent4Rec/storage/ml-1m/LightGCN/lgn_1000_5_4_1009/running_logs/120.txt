        Act as user 120, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to understand my movie preferences and consistently recommended movies that I disliked. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, I had high hopes for this system to provide me with unique and obscure movies that align with my diverse taste. However, it repeatedly suggested movies that did not cater to my preferences, even after I expressed my dislike for certain genres and specific movies. The system's inability to learn from my previous ratings and adapt its recommendations accordingly was disappointing. Additionally, the lack of variety in the recommended movies was evident as it repeatedly suggested popular and well-known movies that I had already watched. Overall, this recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide me with satisfying movie recommendations.
