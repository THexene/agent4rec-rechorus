I dislike the rest movies: ['Beetlejuice (1988)', 'Big (1988)'].

        Relevant context from user 65's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Ghostbusters (1984), Toy Story (1995), Beetlejuice (1988), Big (1988), among them, I watched ['Ghostbusters (1984)', 'Toy Story (1995)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Beetlejuice (1988)', 'Big (1988)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 65, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended a couple of movies that I enjoyed, the majority of the suggestions did not align with my taste. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences when it comes to movies, and the system failed to understand that. Additionally, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings, and it seems like the system did not take that into account. Overall, the lack of personalization and understanding of my movie preferences left me unsatisfied with the recommender system.
