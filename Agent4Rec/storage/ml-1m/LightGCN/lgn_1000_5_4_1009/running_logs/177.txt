        Relevant context from user 177's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Back to the Future, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, among them, I watched ['Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope', 'Back to the Future'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively.

- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Stuart Little, Ghostbusters, Wizard of Oz, The, among them, I watched ['E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial', 'Stuart Little'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Stuart Little', 'Ghostbusters', 'Wizard of Oz, The'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and also recommended movies that I had already rated and did not enjoy.
        Act as user 177, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, the system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. It also suggested movies that I had already rated and did not enjoy. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I expect the recommender system to understand my unique preferences and provide me with diverse and obscure movie choices. However, the system failed to do so, resulting in a disappointing experience. Additionally, the system's reliance on historical ratings did not align with my Maverick Critic trait, as I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not cater to my specific movie preferences.
