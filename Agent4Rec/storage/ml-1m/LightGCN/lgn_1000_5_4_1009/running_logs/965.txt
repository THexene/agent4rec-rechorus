        Relevant context from user 965's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Saving Private Ryan, Sense and Sensibility, Groundhog Day, Maltese Falcon, The, among them, I watched ['Saving Private Ryan', 'Maltese Falcon, The'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively.

        Act as user 965, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. The system recommended movies that I had already indicated I disliked in previous pages, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its recommendations, as it kept suggesting movies from genres that I have consistently shown disinterest in. While the system did recommend a few movies that aligned with my tastes, it was not enough to make up for the overall unsatisfactory experience.
