As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and personalized recommendations. Additionally, the system did not offer any variety or new suggestions that could potentially pique my interest. Overall, the system failed to meet my expectations and did not provide a satisfactory user experience.
