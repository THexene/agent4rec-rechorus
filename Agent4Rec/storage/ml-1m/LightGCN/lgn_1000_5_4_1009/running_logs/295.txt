I dislike the rest movies: ['Rear Window (1954)', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislikes from the previous page and continued to recommend movies that I did not enjoy.
        Act as user 295, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my preferences, it failed to take into account my dislikes from the previous page. This lack of personalization made me feel like the system was not paying attention to my preferences and made the recommendations less relevant to me. Additionally, as an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and accurate recommendation to make the most of my limited movie-watching opportunities.
