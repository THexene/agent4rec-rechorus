        Act as user 648, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite being an occasional viewer, I had specific movie tastes that I clearly communicated through my activity, conformity, and diversity traits. However, the recommender system failed to understand my preferences and repeatedly recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. It also suggested movies that I had already watched and rated lower than expected. This shows a lack of understanding and consideration for my individual taste. As a result, I did not find the recommendations helpful or aligned with my preferences.
