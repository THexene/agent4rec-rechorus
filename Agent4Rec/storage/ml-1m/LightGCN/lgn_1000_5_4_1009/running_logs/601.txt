        Relevant context from user 601's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Gladiator (2000), Men in Black (1997), Bug's Life, A (1998), Galaxy Quest (1999), among them, I watched ['Gladiator (2000)', 'Men in Black (1997)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Jurassic Park (1993), Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983), Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999), Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), among them, I watched ['Jurassic Park (1993)', 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not provide any new movies that I had not already watched and rated.
        Act as user 601, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to provide any new movies that I had not already watched and rated. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I rarely watch movies and when I do, it's a special event. Therefore, I was hoping that the recommender system would introduce me to unique and obscure films that align with my Cinematic Trailblazer trait. However, the system only recommended movies that I had already seen, which left me feeling unsatisfied. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and not historical ratings. Unfortunately, the recommender system did not take this into account and recommended movies based on popular opinion rather than my personal preferences. Overall, the lack of diversity and failure to consider my unique movie tastes made this recommender system ineffective for me.
