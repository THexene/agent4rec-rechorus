RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, the system consistently recommended movies that I disliked, resulting in a lack of enjoyment and wasted time. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the system failed to accurately understand my movie preferences and provide me with suitable recommendations. Additionally, the lack of variety in the recommendations further contributed to my dissatisfaction. Overall, this recommender system did not meet my needs as a viewer with selective tastes, and I was left unsatisfied with the movie choices it presented to me.
