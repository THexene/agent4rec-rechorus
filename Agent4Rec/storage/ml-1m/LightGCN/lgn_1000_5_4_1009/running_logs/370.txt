        Act as user 370, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the recommendations it provided. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the system recommended a lot of movies that I did not enjoy, and I only found a few movies that matched my preferences. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my movie preferences. Additionally, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate diversity and uniqueness in movies, but the recommendations seemed to be more mainstream and did not offer me any avant-garde options. Overall, the system failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
