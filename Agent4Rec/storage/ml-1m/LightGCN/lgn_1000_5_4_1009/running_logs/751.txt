        Relevant context from user 751's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Sleepless in Seattle, Shakespeare in Love, Bug's Life, A, Chicken Run, among them, I watched ["Bug's Life, A", 'Chicken Run'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Chicken Run', 'Sleepless in Seattle', 'Shakespeare in Love'].

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Dave (1993), Toy Story 2 (1999), Jerry Maguire (1996), Much Ado About Nothing (1993), among them, I watched ['Toy Story 2 (1999)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Dave (1993)', 'Jerry Maguire (1996)', 'Much Ado About Nothing (1993)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 751, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I had already watched and disliked. It also did not take into account my diverse taste in movies, as it kept suggesting movies from genres that I am not interested in. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it repeated movies that I had already seen and rated. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with relevant and diverse movie recommendations.
