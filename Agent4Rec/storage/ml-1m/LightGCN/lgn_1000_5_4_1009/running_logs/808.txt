RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in recommending movies that aligned with my taste for thrilling and suspenseful, thought-provoking and mysterious, intense and action-packed, and classic and iconic movies. I appreciated that it included movies like L.A. Confidential, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Reservoir Dogs, and North by Northwest, which I enjoyed watching and rated highly. However, I was disappointed with some of the recommendations, such as Being John Malkovich, Schindler's List, Gone with the Wind, Three Kings, Toy Story, Out of Sight, and Chasing Amy, which I did not like. The system's inability to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy led to my dissatisfaction. I would have preferred a more accurate and personalized recommendation system.
