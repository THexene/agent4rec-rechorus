        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Groundhog Day, Forrest Gump, Shakespeare in Love, Back to the Future, among them, I watched ['Groundhog Day', 'Forrest Gump'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Shakespeare in Love'].

RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system was decent, but not exceptional. While it did recommend a couple of movies that I enjoyed, such as "Groundhog Day" and "Forrest Gump," it also suggested movies like "Shakespeare in Love" which I didn't like at all. The system did take into account my preferred genres, which I appreciate, but it could have done a better job in understanding my specific tastes within those genres. Additionally, I felt that the system could have provided more personalized recommendations based on my previous ratings. Overall, it was an okay experience, but there is definitely room for improvement.
