[EXIT]; Reason: I am unsatisfied with the recommendations and I am starting to feel tired.

You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 363 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: A Niche Explorer who occasionally explores different genres and mostly sticks to preferred movie types.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy classic movies.;  have a fondness for adventure and action films.;  appreciate science fiction and fantasy genres.;  enjoy heartwarming and romantic films.;  have a taste for drama and historical movies.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 363, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 out of 10. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and personalized recommendations. However, I found that the system failed to consistently understand my movie tastes and often suggested movies that I disliked. This lack of accuracy and personalization greatly affected my satisfaction with the system. Additionally, the system did not take into account my conformity trait, as I sometimes give ratings that differ from historical ratings. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt the need to exit the system after browsing just a few pages.
