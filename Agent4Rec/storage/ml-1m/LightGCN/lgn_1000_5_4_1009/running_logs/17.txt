        Relevant context from user 17's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), Boat, The (Das Boot) (1981), Casablanca (1942), Princess Bride, The (1987), among them, I watched ['Cyrano de Bergerac (1990)', 'Casablanca (1942)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Boat, The (Das Boot) (1981)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 17, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in recommending movies that aligned with my taste. I enjoyed watching "Cyrano de Bergerac" and "Casablanca" as they fit into my preferred genres of classic romance and dramatic films. However, the system failed to provide enough options that catered to my specific preferences, such as action-packed thrillers and psychological dramas. Additionally, the system recommended a movie, "Boat, The (Das Boot)", which I did not enjoy at all. Overall, while the system had some hits, it lacked the variety and accuracy I was hoping for.
