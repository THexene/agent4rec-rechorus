RATING: 3
REASON: Although the recommender system did suggest some movies that aligned with my preferences, it failed to provide enough variety and diversity in its recommendations. I was hoping to discover new movies that I hadn't seen before, but instead, it suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. Additionally, the system didn't take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it recommended movies that were similar to ones I had already rated poorly. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system didn't understand my movie tastes well enough.
