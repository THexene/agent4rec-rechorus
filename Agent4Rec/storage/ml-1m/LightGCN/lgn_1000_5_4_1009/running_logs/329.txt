MOVIE: Braveheart (1995); ALIGN: Yes; REASON: I enjoy action-packed movies and Braveheart fits into that genre. The historical ratings are also quite high, which indicates that it might be a good choice for me.
MOVIE: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977); ALIGN: Yes; REASON: I appreciate science fiction movies, and Star Wars is a classic in that genre. The historical ratings are also very high, which makes it even more appealing.
MOVIE: American Pie (1999); ALIGN: No; REASON: Although American Pie is a comedy film, it focuses on teenage humor and sexual encounters, which is not my cup of tea. The historical ratings are also not as high as the other movies.
MOVIE: Shakespeare in Love (1998); ALIGN: No; REASON: While I do enjoy classic and timeless films, Shakespeare in Love is more of a romantic drama, which is not my preferred genre. The historical ratings are decent, but it doesn't align with my taste for intense and thought-provoking dramas.

NUM: 2; WATCH: Braveheart (1995), Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977); REASON: Both movies align with my taste and have high historical ratings. They are also well-known and highly regarded in their respective genres.

MOVIE: Braveheart (1995); RATING: 4; FEELING: I thoroughly enjoyed Braveheart. The action sequences were thrilling, and the story of rebellion was captivating. The historical ratings were spot on.
MOVIE: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977); RATING: 5; FEELING: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope exceeded my expectations. The world-building and the epic battle between good and evil were enthralling. The historical ratings were definitely justified.

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the occasional movie recommendations that align with my taste, the majority of the movies suggested to me did not meet my preferences. I found that I disliked most of the movies recommended on page 3, which was disappointing. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my diverse and avant-garde movie choices, as it mostly recommended popular and mainstream films. As an Occasional Viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and accurate recommendation experience.
