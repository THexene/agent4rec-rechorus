        Relevant context from user 573's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Matrix, The (1999), True Lies (1994), Fifth Element, The (1997), Armageddon (1998), among them, I watched ['Matrix, The (1999)', 'True Lies (1994)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['True Lies (1994)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Rock, The (1996), Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983), Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999), Independence Day (ID4) (1996), among them, I watched ['Rock, The (1996)', 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Independence Day (ID4) (1996)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 573, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and personalized recommendations. However, the system failed to do so by suggesting movies that I had already seen and did not enjoy. This lack of understanding and consideration for my preferences greatly diminished my satisfaction with the system.
