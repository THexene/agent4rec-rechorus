        Relevant context from user 388's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Gladiator, American Beauty, Fight Club, among them, I watched ['Terminator 2: Judgment Day', 'American Beauty'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Gladiator'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Contender, The, Jurassic Park, Perfect Storm, The, Patriot, The, among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Contender, The', 'Jurassic Park', 'Perfect Storm, The', 'Patriot, The'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations on the second page.
        Act as user 388, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide me with satisfactory recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, this recommender system did not take into account my unique movie-watching habits and instead suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences greatly disappointed me. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations on the second page, further highlighting its inability to cater to my selective viewing habits. Overall, this recommender system did not meet my needs as a discerning viewer, and I was left unsatisfied with the experience.
