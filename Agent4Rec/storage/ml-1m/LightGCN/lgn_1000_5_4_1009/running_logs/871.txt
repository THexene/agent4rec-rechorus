        Act as user 871, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to satisfy my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the system recommended several movies that I disliked, such as "Schindler's List", "Amadeus", "Saving Private Ryan", and "Shawshank Redemption". This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my preferences and failed to provide me with suitable recommendations. Additionally, the system heavily relies on historical ratings for conformity, which limits the diversity of the recommendations. As a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate unique and obscure movies, but the system did not offer any such options. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfying movie recommendations.
