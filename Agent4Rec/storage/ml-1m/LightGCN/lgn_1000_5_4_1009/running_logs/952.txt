        Relevant context from user 952's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Galaxy Quest, Wild Wild West, Arachnophobia, Alien, among them, I watched ['Galaxy Quest'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Wild Wild West', 'Arachnophobia'].

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Fly, The, Blair Witch Project, The, Mad Max 2 (a.k.a. The Road Warrior), among them, I watched ['Terminator 2: Judgment Day'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Fly, The', 'Blair Witch Project, The'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations that matched my preferences.
        Act as user 952, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I rarely watch movies and when I do, it's a special event. However, the recommender system failed to provide me with new and exciting recommendations that aligned with my movie preferences. It suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, which was disappointing. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations that matched my preferred genres, such as classic science fiction or thought-provoking movies. Overall, the system did not cater to my unique movie tastes and did not provide me with a satisfactory experience.
