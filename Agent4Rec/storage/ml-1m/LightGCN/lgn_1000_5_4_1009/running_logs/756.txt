        Act as user 756, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my preferences, the majority of the recommended movies did not align with my taste. I only enjoyed and rated positively a few movies out of the ones recommended to me. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my preferences and failed to provide me with relevant recommendations. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an occasional viewer, I rely on the recommender system to provide me with accurate and tailored recommendations, but this system fell short in meeting my expectations.
