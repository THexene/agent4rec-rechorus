        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the effort in recommending movies based on my taste, the system failed to provide me with satisfactory recommendations. The majority of the suggested movies did not align with my preferences, and I disliked most of them. Additionally, the system did not seem to learn from my previous ratings and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited patience for unsatisfactory recommendations, and after browsing four pages without finding any appealing options, I decided to leave the system. The lack of variety and failure to cater to my specific taste left me disappointed.
