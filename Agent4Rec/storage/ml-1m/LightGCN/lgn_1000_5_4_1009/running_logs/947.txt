        Act as user 947, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and rarely watch movies. The system recommended a variety of movies to me, but the majority of them did not align with my preferences. While I did watch a few movies and gave them ratings based on my personal preferences, the system failed to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, the conformity trait of the system, which considers historical ratings, sometimes influenced my ratings to be different from the historical ratings. This made it difficult for me to trust the recommendations. Overall, the system did not cater to my highly selective movie taste and failed to provide satisfactory recommendations.
