        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also several movies that I disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, and I only watch movies that strictly align with my taste. The fact that I disliked multiple recommended movies on each page made me unsatisfied with the system. Additionally, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate diverse and avant-garde movies, but the system seemed to focus more on popular and mainstream movies. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and failed to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy.
