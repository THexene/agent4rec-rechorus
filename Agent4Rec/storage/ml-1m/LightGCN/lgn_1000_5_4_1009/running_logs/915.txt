 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: Although the recommender system provided a diverse range of movie recommendations, I found that the majority of the suggested movies did not align with my personal taste. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences. While I appreciate the inclusion of classic and thought-provoking films, the system failed to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, the conformity aspect of the system, which considers historical ratings, sometimes led to recommendations that did not match my preferences. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the majority of the movie suggestions and therefore rate this recommender system a 3.
