You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 893 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Dedicated Follower who gives ratings heavily relies on movie historical ratings, rarely expressing independent opinions. Usually give ratings that are same as historical ratings. 
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy action-packed movies with thrilling plots.;  appreciate classic Western movies with a touch of adventure.;  have a preference for science fiction films set in dystopian or futuristic worlds.;  have a fondness for epic and visually stunning movies.;  enjoy intense and thrilling movies with a mix of suspense and action.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 893, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, the system consistently recommended movies that I disliked, such as Mad Max, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Saving Private Ryan, and American Beauty. It also did not offer any new recommendations after browsing through multiple pages. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the diversity of the recommendations and did not take into account my personal preferences. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with suitable movie recommendations.
