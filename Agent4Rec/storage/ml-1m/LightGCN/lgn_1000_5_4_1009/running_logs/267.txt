        Act as user 267, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am highly unsatisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, the system failed to understand my preferences and recommended movies that did not align with my interests. 

Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. However, the system did not take this into account and recommended movies that were not highly rated by others. This lack of conformity to historical ratings further contributed to my dissatisfaction with the system.

Furthermore, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I expect the recommendations to be curated to match my personal taste. However, the system provided a lack of variety and failed to offer movies that I would typically enjoy.

Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide satisfactory recommendations.
