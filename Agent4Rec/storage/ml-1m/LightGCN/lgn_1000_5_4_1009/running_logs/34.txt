        Act as user 34, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my specific movie tastes and preferences, the system consistently recommended movies that did not align with my preferences. I only enjoyed a few of the recommended movies and disliked the majority of them. The system failed to understand my unique taste and did not provide me with personalized recommendations. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed dislike for. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
