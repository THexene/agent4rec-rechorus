I dislike the rest movies: ['Babe (1995)', 'Much Ado About Nothing (1993)', 'Wag the Dog (1997)'].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 907, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the occasional movie recommendations that align with my taste, the majority of the recommended movies did not appeal to me. I found myself disliking most of the movies suggested on all three pages. As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I expect the recommendations to be meticulously curated to match my personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety. However, the system failed to meet this expectation. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. Overall, the recommender system did not effectively cater to my specific movie preferences, leading to my dissatisfaction.
