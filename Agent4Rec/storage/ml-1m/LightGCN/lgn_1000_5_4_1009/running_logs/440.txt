Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Dedicated Follower who gives ratings heavily relies on movie historical ratings, rarely expressing independent opinions. Usually give ratings that are same as historical ratings. 
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy classic movies.;  appreciate action-packed movies.;  have a fondness for suspenseful thrillers.;  am a fan of historical dramas.;  enjoy adventure movies.;  appreciate well-crafted mysteries.;  enjoy romantic movies.;  like intense action-thrillers.;  enjoy movies with special effects.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 440, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, I was unsatisfied with the overall result. I disliked several of the recommended movies and felt that the system did not fully understand my preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it mostly suggested movies from genres that I already enjoy. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more diverse range of movie suggestions that could potentially introduce me to new genres or styles. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 4 out of 10.
