        Act as user 803, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide satisfactory recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, this recommender system repeatedly suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my preferences and a failure to provide personalized recommendations. Additionally, the system did not take into account my diverse taste in movies, as it consistently recommended movies within the same genres that I enjoy. Overall, the system did not meet my needs as a Balanced Evaluator who values both historical ratings and personal preferences.
