RATING: 2
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to provide me with new and unique recommendations that align with my diverse taste in movies. It recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, without taking into account my preference for classic movies, science fiction, Westerns, suspenseful thrillers, comedy films, and movies with unique and thought-provoking concepts. The lack of personalized and diverse recommendations greatly diminished my interest in the system.
