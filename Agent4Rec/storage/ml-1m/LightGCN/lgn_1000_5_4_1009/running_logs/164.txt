        Act as user 164, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my preferences, the majority of the movies suggested did not align with my taste. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommendations to be accurate and appealing. However, the system failed to consistently suggest movies that I enjoyed. Additionally, the conformity aspect of the system, which considers historical ratings, did not always result in accurate recommendations for me. Overall, I found the system to be lacking in understanding my specific preferences and providing me with satisfying movie choices.
