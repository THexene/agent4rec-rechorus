        Act as user 251, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, and this system did not meet my expectations. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the recommendations were not aligned with my movie tastes. I only watched a few of the recommended movies and enjoyed even fewer. The system suggested movies that I disliked multiple times, which indicates a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the infrequency of my movie-watching habits makes it crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and tailored recommendations, which this system failed to do. Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommendations and the system's inability to cater to my niche movie preferences.
