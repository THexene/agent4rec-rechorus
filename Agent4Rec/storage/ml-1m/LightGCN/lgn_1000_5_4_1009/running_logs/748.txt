        Relevant context from user 748's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: You've Got Mail, Ghost, Anna and the King, Tomorrow Never Dies, among them, I watched ["You've Got Mail", 'Ghost'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Anna and the King', 'Tomorrow Never Dies'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Titanic, Groundhog Day, Contact, Dave, among them, I watched ['Titanic'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Groundhog Day', 'Contact', 'Dave'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them to me.
        Act as user 748, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences, and it is important for a recommender system to respect that. However, this system failed to do so, resulting in a lack of satisfaction. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and not historical ratings, so the system's reliance on historical ratings did not align with my preferences. Overall, this system did not meet my expectations and did not provide personalized recommendations, leading to my dissatisfaction.
