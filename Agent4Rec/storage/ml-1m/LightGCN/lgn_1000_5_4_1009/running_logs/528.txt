        Relevant context from user 528's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Fargo (1996), Silence of the Lambs, The (1991), Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), Pulp Fiction (1994), among them, I watched ['Fargo (1996)', 'Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively.

- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Sixth Sense, The (1999), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Usual Suspects, The (1995), among them, I watched ['Sixth Sense, The (1999)', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I have already watched and rated all the recommended movies.
        Act as user 528, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie-watching habits and preferences. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my tastes, such as Fargo and Silence of the Lambs, it failed to provide enough diverse and unique options for me. I appreciate the inclusion of classic and iconic movies like Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope and Raiders of the Lost Ark, but the majority of the recommendations were not appealing to me. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and the fact that I had already watched and rated all the recommended movies. This lack of personalization and consideration for my viewing history left me unsatisfied with the overall experience. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 3 out of 10.
