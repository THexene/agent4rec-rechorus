- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations based on my preferences.
        Act as user 634, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. The system failed to provide me with new recommendations based on my preferences. It recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my taste. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I rely heavily on the recommender system to suggest movies that align with my preferences. However, the system did not meet my expectations and did not offer any variety or captivating options. Additionally, the system did not take into account my activity trait, as it continued to recommend movies even after I expressed dissatisfaction. Overall, the system did not cater to my specific movie-watching habits, conformity, and diversity traits, resulting in a disappointing experience.
