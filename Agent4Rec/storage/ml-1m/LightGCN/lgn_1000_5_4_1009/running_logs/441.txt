        Act as user 441, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my specific movie preferences, the system recommended a significant number of movies that did not align with my taste. Out of the movies I watched, I only enjoyed a few and disliked the majority. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my preferences and failed to provide recommendations that I would enjoy. As an occasional viewer, I rely on the recommender system to suggest movies that strictly align with my taste, and this system did not meet my expectations. Therefore, I am not satisfied with the recommender system and would rate it a 3.
