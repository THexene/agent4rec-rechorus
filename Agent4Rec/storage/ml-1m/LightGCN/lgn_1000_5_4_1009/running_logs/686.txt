        Act as user 686, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I did find a few movies that I enjoyed, the majority of the recommendations did not align with my taste. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences when it comes to movies, and the system failed to consistently provide me with movies that matched my preferences. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not effectively cater to my selective viewing habits.
