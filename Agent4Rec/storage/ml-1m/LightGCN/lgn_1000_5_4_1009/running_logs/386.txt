        Act as user 386, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I didn't enjoy. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and I expect the recommender system to understand and cater to those preferences. However, I found that I had already watched and rated most of the recommended movies, which was disappointing. Additionally, there were a few movies that I disliked, indicating that the system didn't fully understand my preferences. Overall, the system didn't provide me with enough variety or accuracy in its recommendations, leading to my dissatisfaction.
