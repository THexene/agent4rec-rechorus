        Act as user 974, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my preferences, the majority of the movies suggested did not align with my taste. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste, and I tend to exit the recommender system if I have a few unsatisfied memories. In this case, I disliked the majority of the movies recommended to me, which indicates a lack of accuracy in understanding my preferences. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and disregard historical ratings. However, it seems that the system heavily relies on historical ratings, which may not accurately reflect my preferences. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 3.
