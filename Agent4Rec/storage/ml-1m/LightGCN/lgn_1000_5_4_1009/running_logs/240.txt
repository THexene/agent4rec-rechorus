RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system had some hits and misses in terms of recommending movies that aligned with my taste. I appreciated that it recommended movies from genres I enjoy, such as dramatic movies, suspenseful thrillers, and classic movies. I also liked that it took into account both historical ratings and my personal preferences when giving recommendations. However, I was unsatisfied with a significant number of the recommended movies, which led me to exit the system after browsing through five pages. The system could have done a better job in understanding my preferences and avoiding recommending movies that I clearly disliked. Overall, while the system had some positive aspects, it did not consistently meet my expectations, resulting in a mediocre rating of 5.
