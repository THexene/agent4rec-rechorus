RATING: 4
REASON: Although the recommender system provided me with some movies that I enjoyed, the majority of the recommendations did not align with my personal taste. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommendations to be highly tailored to my preferences. However, the system failed to consistently suggest movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not consistently provide movies with high historical ratings. Therefore, I am not satisfied with the recommender system and rate it a 4 out of 10.
