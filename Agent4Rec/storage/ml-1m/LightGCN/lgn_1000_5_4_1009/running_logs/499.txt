        Act as user 499, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to provide me with recommendations that aligned with my taste. The majority of the recommended movies were not to my liking, and I only watched and enjoyed a few of them. Additionally, the system did not take into account my preference for specific genres such as romantic comedies, action and adventure, coming-of-age dramas, family-friendly and feel-good movies, and crime and thriller movies. The lack of personalization and the inability to understand my unique taste greatly impacted my satisfaction with the system.
