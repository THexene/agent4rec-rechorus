        Act as user 487, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite exploring multiple pages, the system failed to recommend movies that aligned with my taste. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones recommended, and the majority of them were not to my liking. The system did not accurately understand my preferences and consistently recommended movies that I disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited patience for unsatisfactory recommendations, and this system did not meet my expectations.
