RATING: 6
REASON: While the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. The system did not take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, which resulted in me wasting time watching movies that I did not enjoy. However, I appreciate the diversity of movie choices and the fact that the system introduced me to some unique and obscure films that I may not have discovered otherwise. Overall, the system has room for improvement in terms of personalization and taking into account user preferences.
