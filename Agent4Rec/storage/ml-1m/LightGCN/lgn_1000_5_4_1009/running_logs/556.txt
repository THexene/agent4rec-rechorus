        Act as user 556, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as American Beauty and Pulp Fiction, the majority of the recommended movies, like Braveheart and Boogie Nights, did not appeal to me. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my movie tastes and failed to provide me with a satisfactory selection. Additionally, the system did not take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits, as it continued to recommend movies even after I expressed dissatisfaction with the previous recommendations. Overall, the system's inability to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy and its lack of consideration for my viewing habits left me unsatisfied.
