 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide accurate recommendations based on my preferences. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, this recommender system did not take into account my unique movie-watching habits and instead provided recommendations that did not align with my interests. 

Additionally, as a maverick critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and disregard historical ratings. However, this recommender system seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings, which resulted in recommendations that were not in line with my preferences. 

Furthermore, as an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I expect a high level of curation and exclusivity in the movie choices presented to me. However, this recommender system did not provide any new recommendations based on my preferences after browsing through three pages. 

Overall, this recommender system did not cater to my unique movie-watching habits, failed to provide accurate recommendations based on my taste, and lacked the level of curation and exclusivity I expect. Therefore, I rate it a 3.
