        Relevant context from user 753's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Braindead (1992), Village of the Damned (1960), Damien: Omen II (1978), Night of the Living Dead (1968), among them, I watched ['Braindead (1992)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Village of the Damned (1960)', 'Damien: Omen II (1978)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Shining, The (1980), Rosemary's Baby (1968), Misery (1990), Re-Animator (1985), among them, I watched ['Shining, The (1980)', "Rosemary's Baby (1968)"] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Misery (1990)', 'Re-Animator (1985)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I disliked on both page 1 and page 2.
        Act as user 753, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am extremely unsatisfied with the recommender system. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and rarely watch movies. The system failed to understand my preferences and recommended movies that I clearly disliked on both page 1 and page 2. The system did not take into account my Maverick Critic trait, completely ignoring historical ratings and solely relying on my own taste. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I expect the recommendations to be meticulously curated to match my personal taste, but the system failed to do so. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and I will not be using it again.
