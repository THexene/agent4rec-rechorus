RATING: 7; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 7. While it did provide me with some movies that I enjoyed and rated highly, there were also instances where it recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This repetition was a bit frustrating and made me question the effectiveness of the system. However, I appreciate that the recommender system did introduce me to a few new movies that I ended up enjoying. Overall, it was a decent experience, but there is definitely room for improvement in terms of avoiding repetition and providing more personalized recommendations.
