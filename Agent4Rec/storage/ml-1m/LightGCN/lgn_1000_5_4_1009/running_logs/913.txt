        Act as user 913, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6
REASON: While the recommender system did provide me with some enjoyable movie recommendations, I found that it lacked the ability to remember my previous interactions. It repeatedly suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, which was frustrating. Additionally, I felt that the system could have offered more diverse and avant-garde movie choices, as it seemed to focus mostly on popular and mainstream films. However, I appreciate that the system took into account both historical ratings and my personal preferences when making recommendations, which added some level of customization. Overall, I would rate this recommender system a 6 because it had its strengths but also some significant areas for improvement.
