Relevant context from your memory:

I dislike the rest movies: ['Sense and Sensibility (1995)', 'English Patient, The (1996)', 'Jerry Maguire (1996)'].

        Relevant context from user 979's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Notting Hill (1999), English Patient, The (1996), Jerry Maguire (1996), Sense and Sensibility (1995), among them, I watched ['Notting Hill (1999)', 'Sense and Sensibility (1995)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Sense and Sensibility (1995)', 'English Patient, The (1996)', 'Jerry Maguire (1996)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 979, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6
REASON: While the recommender system did recommend a couple of movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Notting Hill" and "Sense and Sensibility," I was not completely satisfied with the overall experience. The system failed to provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it only suggested movies within the romantic comedy and romantic drama genres. As an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I appreciate a wider range of genres and would have liked to see recommendations that catered to my other interests, such as thought-provoking dramas, suspenseful thrillers, and historical films. Additionally, the system did not take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits, as it presented me with a large number of recommendations in just one page. This overwhelming amount of choices made it difficult for me to find movies that truly piqued my interest. Overall, while the system had some positive aspects, it fell short in terms of variety and understanding my unique movie-watching preferences.
