RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and it is important for the recommender system to respect those preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it kept suggesting movies from the same genres over and over again. As an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I appreciate a mix of genres and unique storytelling. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and left me unsatisfied.
