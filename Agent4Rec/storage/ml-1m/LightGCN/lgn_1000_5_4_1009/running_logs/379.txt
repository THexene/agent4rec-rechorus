        Act as user 379, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because I am extremely unsatisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my specific movie preferences and selectivity, the majority of the recommended movies did not align with my taste. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones I watched, and the rest were not to my liking. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have high expectations for the movies I choose to watch, and this recommender system failed to meet those expectations. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. Overall, this system did not effectively cater to my unique movie preferences and did not provide satisfactory recommendations.
