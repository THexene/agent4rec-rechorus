RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in recommending movies that aligned with my taste. I appreciated the suggestions of "Sixth Sense, The" and "Fight Club" as they were both thrilling and thought-provoking movies. However, I was disappointed with the recommendation of "Forrest Gump" as it did not match my preferences for intense dramas or suspenseful movies. Additionally, the system only recommended a few movies on the first page, which limited my options. Overall, while the system had some hits, it could have provided more diverse recommendations and better understood my specific preferences.
