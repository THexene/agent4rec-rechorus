        Act as user 657, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to understand my movie preferences and consistently recommended movies that I disliked. Despite providing feedback by rating the movies I watched, the system did not seem to adapt or improve its recommendations. As an occasional viewer, I rely heavily on the recommender system to suggest movies that align with my taste, but it consistently fell short in this regard. Additionally, the system did not take into account my conformity trait, as it did not provide historical ratings or align with my usual preferences. Overall, I am dissatisfied with the recommender system's performance and its inability to cater to my specific movie preferences.
