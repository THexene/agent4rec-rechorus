RATING: 5
REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in suggesting movies that align with my personal taste. I enjoyed watching "American Beauty" and "Godfather: Part II" as they were thought-provoking and had emotional depth. However, I was disappointed with the recommendation of "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" as it did not match my preference for action-packed movies. The system could have been more accurate in understanding my specific movie preferences and avoiding suggestions that I would not enjoy. Additionally, the limited number of movies recommended on just one page made me feel like there wasn't enough variety to choose from. Overall, while the system had some hits, it still has room for improvement in terms of understanding my taste and providing a wider range of recommendations.
