        Act as user 724, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I am not very satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I had already watched and disliked. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend similar movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited patience for unsatisfactory recommendations, and the lack of personalization in this system was a major drawback for me.
