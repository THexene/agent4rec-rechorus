        Relevant context from user 777's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Alien (1979), Time Bandits (1981), My Favorite Year (1982), Godfather: Part II, The (1974), among them, I watched ['Alien (1979)', 'Time Bandits (1981)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively.

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Local Hero (1983), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Bull Durham (1988), Airplane!

- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 777, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the diversity of movie choices it provided, the system failed to understand my movie preferences and recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately suggest movies that align with my tastes. Additionally, the system did not take into account my conformity trait, as it recommended movies with high historical ratings that did not necessarily match my personal preferences. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
