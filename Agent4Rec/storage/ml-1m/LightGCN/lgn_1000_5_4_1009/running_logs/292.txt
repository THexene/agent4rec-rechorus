RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my incredibly infrequent movie-watching habits, the system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an elusive occasional viewer, I expect the recommender to understand my preferences and suggest movies that align with my taste. However, the system failed to do so, resulting in a waste of my time and leaving me unsatisfied. Additionally, the lack of variety in the recommendations was disappointing. I was hoping for more unconventional and edgy films, but the system seemed to focus on mainstream choices. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to cater to my unique movie preferences.
