This shows a lack of understanding of my preferences and a failure to provide me with new and diverse movie options. Additionally, the system did not take into account my preference for classic movies with historical settings, movies with strong female leads, and romantic and dramatic films. Overall, the recommendations did not align with my unique taste and failed to provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
