RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my insatiable appetite for films and willingness to watch nearly every movie recommended to me, I found that the majority of the recommended movies did not align with my movie tastes. I disliked most of the movies that were recommended to me, and it took too long to find movies that I was interested in. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations.
