        Act as user 266, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested a significant number of movies that I disliked. The system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences when generating recommendations, which resulted in a lack of personalization. Additionally, after browsing through three pages of recommendations, the system did not provide any new suggestions based on my preferences, which was disappointing. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not effectively cater to my specific movie tastes.
