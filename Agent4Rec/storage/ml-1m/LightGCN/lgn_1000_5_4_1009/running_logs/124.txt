You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as a user exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:

Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Dedicated Follower who gives ratings heavily relies on movie historical ratings, rarely expressing independent opinions. Usually give ratings that are same as historical ratings. 
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  have a preference for 1980s movies.;  enjoy comedy movies.;  appreciate romantic movies.;  enjoy coming-of-age movies.;  have a preference for sci-fi/fantasy movies.. 
And your rating tendency is  I tend to give high ratings to movies that are from the 1980s, comedies, romantic movies, coming-of-age movies, and sci-fi/fantasy movies.
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Relevant context from user 124's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Breakfast Club, The (1985), Bull Durham (1988), Risky Business (1983), Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985), among them, I watched ['Breakfast Club, The (1985)', "Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985)"] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively.

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Rain Man (1988), Stripes (1981), Field of Dreams (1989), Sixteen Candles (1984), among them, I watched ['Rain Man (1988)', 'Field of Dreams (1989)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Field of Dreams (1989)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 124, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. The system recommended movies to me that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and the system failed to understand that. Additionally, the system did not provide any variety in its recommendations, sticking to the same genre and time period. As a dedicated follower who relies on historical ratings, I expected the system to understand my preferences better and suggest movies that align with my taste. However, it seemed to overlook my preferences and simply suggested popular movies from the 1980s. Overall, the lack of personalization and failure to consider my previous ratings and dislikes left me unsatisfied with the recommender system.
