Additionally, after browsing through four pages, the recommender system did not provide any new recommendations based on my preferences. As an occasional viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I expect the recommender system to understand my taste and provide relevant suggestions. In this case, the system failed to consistently meet my expectations, resulting in a lower rating.
