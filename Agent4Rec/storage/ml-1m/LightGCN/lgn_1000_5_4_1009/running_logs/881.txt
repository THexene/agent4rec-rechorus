REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations as an Occasional Viewer. While it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, such as Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the majority of the recommendations did not appeal to me. I appreciate the system taking into account my preference for action and sci-fi movies, as well as classic and historical films, but it failed to provide a diverse range of options that I would be interested in. Additionally, the system did not seem to consider my dislike for certain genres, as it continued to recommend movies like Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace and Galaxy Quest, which I did not enjoy. Overall, I did not find the recommendations satisfying and would have liked to see more variety and accuracy in the system's suggestions.
