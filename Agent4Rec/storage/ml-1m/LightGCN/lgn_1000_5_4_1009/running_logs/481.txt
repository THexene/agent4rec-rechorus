- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not provide any new movies on page 2 that I had not already watched or disliked.
        Act as user 481, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with any new movie recommendations on the second page. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While I appreciate the initial recommendations of Saving Private Ryan and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the system did not offer any additional options that aligned with my interests. This lack of variety and failure to introduce me to new movies left me unsatisfied with the overall experience. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous dislikes, as it still recommended movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
