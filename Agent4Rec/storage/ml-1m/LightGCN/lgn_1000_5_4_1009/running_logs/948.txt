        Act as user 948, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate that it recommended some movies that align with my taste, the majority of the recommended movies were not to my liking. I only enjoyed a few of the movies suggested to me and disliked most of them. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my preferences and failed to provide me with relevant recommendations. As an occasional viewer, I rely heavily on the recommender system to suggest movies that align with my taste, and when it fails to do so, it diminishes my overall satisfaction. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 3 out of 10.
