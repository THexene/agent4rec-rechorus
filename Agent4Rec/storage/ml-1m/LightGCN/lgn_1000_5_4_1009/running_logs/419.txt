        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes in movies, including action-packed, war, classic, dramatic, and comedy genres. However, the system consistently recommended movies that did not align with my preferences. Despite watching a few movies and giving them ratings based on historical ratings, the system did not seem to understand my selective viewing habits. It recommended movies like Godfather, The, Poseidon Adventure, The, Godfather: Part II, The, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, and Amadeus, which I clearly expressed my dislike for. The lack of variety in the recommendations and the system's inability to understand my preferences left me unsatisfied. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 2.
