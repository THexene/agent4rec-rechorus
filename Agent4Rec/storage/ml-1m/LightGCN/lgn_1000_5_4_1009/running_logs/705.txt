        Act as user 705, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended a significant number of movies that I did not enjoy. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, and I only watch movies that strictly align with my taste. The system failed to consistently provide me with satisfying recommendations, as evidenced by my dislike for the majority of the movies it suggested. Additionally, as a Balanced Evaluator, I consider both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. However, the system did not consistently take into account my preferences, as it recommended movies that I did not enjoy despite their high historical ratings. Therefore, I am not fully satisfied with this recommender system.
