        Relevant context from user 872's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Lethal Weapon 2, Lethal Weapon, Spy Who Loved Me, The, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, among them, I watched ['Lethal Weapon 2', 'Lethal Weapon'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Lethal Weapon', 'Spy Who Loved Me, The'].

        Act as user 872, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system did an okay job in recommending movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Lethal Weapon 2" and "Lethal Weapon". However, it also suggested movies like "Spy Who Loved Me, The" which I didn't enjoy. The system could have been more accurate in understanding my preferences and avoiding movies that I wouldn't be interested in. Additionally, the system only recommended movies on the first page, which limited my options and didn't provide enough variety. Overall, while the system had some hits, it also had some misses and could have been more comprehensive in its recommendations.
