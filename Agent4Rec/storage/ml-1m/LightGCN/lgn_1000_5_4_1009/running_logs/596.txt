        Relevant context from user 596's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Jaws, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, Thing, The, Young Frankenstein, among them, I watched ['Jaws', 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively.

- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not provide any new movies for me to watch on page 2.
        Act as user 596, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not provide me with any new movies to watch on the second page of recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I rely heavily on the recommender system to suggest movies that align with my diverse and unique taste. However, the system failed to recommend any movies that I had not already seen or that piqued my interest. Additionally, the conformity trait of the system, which heavily relies on historical ratings, did not cater to my preference for adventure, fantasy, classic, and horror movies. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the lack of new and diverse movie recommendations, leading me to exit the system.
