        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: Although the recommender system initially provided me with some movies that aligned with my preferences, I quickly exhausted those options and was left with a majority of recommendations that I disliked. The system failed to offer me a diverse range of movies that I might enjoy, and I felt unsatisfied with the limited selection. Additionally, the system did not take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits, as it continued to recommend movies even after I had already watched and rated most of them. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not cater to my unique movie-watching patterns.
