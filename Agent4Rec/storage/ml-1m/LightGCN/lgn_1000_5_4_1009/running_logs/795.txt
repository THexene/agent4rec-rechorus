        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to satisfy my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the system recommended a majority of movies that I disliked. Despite providing ratings for the movies I watched, the subsequent recommendations did not improve. This lack of personalization and alignment with my taste left me unsatisfied with the system. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I expect a higher level of curation and exclusivity in the movie choices, which this system did not deliver. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
