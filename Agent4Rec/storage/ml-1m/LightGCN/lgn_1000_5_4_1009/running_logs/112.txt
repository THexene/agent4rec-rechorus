        Act as user 112, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6
REASON: While the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a few instances where it recommended movies that I did not enjoy. The system did take into account my historical ratings and personal preferences, which I appreciate as a Balanced Evaluator. However, as an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations and only watch movies that strictly align with my taste. The system failed to consistently provide me with satisfying recommendations, leading me to exit the system after browsing through five pages. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 6.
