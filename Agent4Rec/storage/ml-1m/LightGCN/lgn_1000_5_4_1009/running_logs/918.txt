        Relevant context from user 918's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: American Beauty, Shakespeare in Love, Sixth Sense, The, Being John Malkovich, among them, I watched ['American Beauty', 'Sixth Sense, The'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively.

- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations based on my preferences.
        Act as user 918, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, the system failed to provide me with new recommendations that aligned with my taste. Instead, it suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This lack of personalization and failure to consider my previous ratings left me unsatisfied. Additionally, the system did not offer any variety or diversity in its recommendations, which is disappointing for someone like me who appreciates a range of genres. Overall, the system did not cater to my unique movie-watching habits and preferences, resulting in a low rating of 3.
