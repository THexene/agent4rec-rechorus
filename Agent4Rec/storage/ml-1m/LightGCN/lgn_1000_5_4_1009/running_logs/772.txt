- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not provide any new movies on page 2 that I would be interested in.

RATING: 3
REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer. While I appreciate the effort in recommending movies based on my diverse taste and ignoring historical ratings, the system failed to provide me with new and unique movie options on the second page. As a Cinematic Trailblazer, I was hoping for more avant-garde and lesser-known films that align with my preferences for thrilling, action-packed, comedic, dramatic, and classic movies. The lack of variety and novelty in the recommendations left me unsatisfied and uninterested in continuing to explore the system.
