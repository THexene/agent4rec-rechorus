RATING: 6
REASON: While the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my tastes, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked.

However, I appreciate that the system took into account both historical ratings and personal preferences when making recommendations. Overall, the system has room for improvement in understanding and catering to my specific movie tastes.
