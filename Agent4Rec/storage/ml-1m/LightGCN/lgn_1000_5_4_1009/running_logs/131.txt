RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations as an occasional viewer with specific movie preferences. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, and it did not provide any new recommendations on page 2. As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I expect the recommender system to understand my taste and provide me with fresh and tailored recommendations. However, this system failed to do so, leading to a lack of satisfaction. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it suggested movies that were not aligned with my usual taste. Overall, this recommender system did not effectively cater to my needs and preferences, resulting in a low rating of 3.
