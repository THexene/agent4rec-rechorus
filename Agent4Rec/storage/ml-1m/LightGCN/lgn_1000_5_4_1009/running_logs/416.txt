RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I was curious to see if this system could align with my taste. However, I found that the recommendations were not tailored to my preferences. While I appreciate the inclusion of classic and cult films, the majority of the movies recommended to me did not align with my liking for action, thriller, adventure, and survival genres. Additionally, the system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which was disappointing. As a Balanced Evaluator, I consider both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings, but the system did not seem to take this into account. Overall, the lack of satisfaction and alignment with my taste leads me to rate this recommender system a 3.
