 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and tailored recommendations. However, the system failed to consistently suggest movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, as a Balanced Evaluator, I consider both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings. The system's recommendations did not always align with my own evaluations, which made me question the reliability of the system. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations, resulting in a lower rating.
