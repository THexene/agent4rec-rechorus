        Act as user 909, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I did not enjoy. The system did not seem to learn from my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed dislike for. Additionally, the system did not provide any new recommendations based on my preferences after a few pages of browsing. As an occasional viewer with specific tastes, I was hoping for a more personalized and accurate recommendation experience.
