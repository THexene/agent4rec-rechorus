RATING: 6
REASON: While the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my tastes, there were also a significant number of movies that I did not enjoy. I appreciate that the system took into account both historical ratings and my personal preferences, but it seems that the diversity characteristic may have led to recommendations that were too far outside of my usual taste. Additionally, the activity characteristic could have been improved as I had to exit the system multiple times due to unsatisfied memories. Overall, the system has room for improvement in better understanding and catering to my specific movie preferences.
