        Act as user 461, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and watch movies infrequently. However, the system failed to accurately recommend movies that align with my preferences. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the recommendations on all three pages did not match my taste for action-packed, thrilling dramas, classic and adventurous, quirky and offbeat, emotional and heartfelt, or western and neo-noir movies. I only enjoyed two out of the eight movies I watched and rated, which is a low success rate for me. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety or options that could potentially expand my movie interests. Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system's performance.
