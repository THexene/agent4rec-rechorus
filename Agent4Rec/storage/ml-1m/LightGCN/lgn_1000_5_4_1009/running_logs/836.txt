REASON: While the recommender system did suggest some movies that aligned with my tastes, such as "Top Hat" and "It Happened One Night," it also recommended movies that I disliked, like "Annie Hall." Additionally, the system did not provide any new recommendations after a few pages, which was disappointing. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and failed to consistently suggest movies that I would enjoy.
