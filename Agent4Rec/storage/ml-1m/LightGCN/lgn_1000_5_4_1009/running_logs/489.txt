        Relevant context from user 489's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Independence Day (ID4), Star Trek: Generations, among them, I watched ['Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope', 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively.

I dislike the rest movies: ['Starship Troopers', 'Lost World: Jurassic Park'].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 489, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my interests, such as Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope and Saving Private Ryan, it also suggested movies that I did not enjoy, like Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace and Star Trek: Generations. 

Additionally, the system failed to understand my diversity trait as a Cinematic Trailblazer. I appreciate unique and obscure movies, but the recommendations seemed to focus on popular and mainstream films. This lack of diversity in the recommendations further contributed to my dissatisfaction.

Furthermore, the conformity trait of the recommender system did not align with my preferences. I consider both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. However, the system seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings, which led to recommendations that did not match my taste.

Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations as an elusive viewer with diverse and specific movie preferences. I would rate it a 3 out of 10.
