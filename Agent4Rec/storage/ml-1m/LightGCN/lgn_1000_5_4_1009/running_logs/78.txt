RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in suggesting movies that aligned with my preferences. I enjoyed watching "Jurassic Park" and "Saving Private Ryan" as they were intense and emotionally impactful, which are qualities I appreciate in movies. However, I was not satisfied with the other recommendations, "Fargo" and "L.A. Confidential," as they did not match my preferred genres. Additionally, I felt that the system could have provided more diverse suggestions, considering my occasional exploration of different genres. Overall, while the recommender system had some hits, it fell short in terms of diversity and fully understanding my movie tastes.
