RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system provided some good movie recommendations that aligned with my taste, such as Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi and The Matrix. I appreciated that it took into account my preferences for sci-fi and fantasy movies, as well as action-packed films. However, I was disappointed that the system kept recommending movies that I had already watched and rated. This made me feel like the system didn't fully understand my movie-watching habits and preferences. Additionally, I would have liked to see more diversity in the recommendations, as I enjoy exploring different genres occasionally. Overall, while the system had its strengths, there is room for improvement in terms of understanding my preferences and providing more varied recommendations.
