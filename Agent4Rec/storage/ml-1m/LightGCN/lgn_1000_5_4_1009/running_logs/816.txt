RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system had some positive aspects, such as recommending movies that aligned with my taste, like "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" and "Alien". I appreciated that it took into account my previous ratings and suggested similar movies. However, I was disappointed with the lack of new recommendations based on my preferences. The system kept suggesting movies that I had already indicated I disliked, like "Lethal Weapon 2" and "Clear and Present Danger". Additionally, the system did not provide any new and unique recommendations that matched my diverse and avant-garde taste. Overall, while the system had some good features, it fell short in terms of providing fresh and tailored recommendations.
