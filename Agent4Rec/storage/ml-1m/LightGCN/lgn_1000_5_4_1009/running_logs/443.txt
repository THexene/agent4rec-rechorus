RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in suggesting movies that align with my preferences. I enjoyed watching "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" and "Jurassic Park," as they are both action-packed and sci-fi movies. However, I was not satisfied with the recommendation of "Big" as it does not fit my preferred movie types. Although the system took into account my movie tastes, it could have been more accurate in predicting my preferences. Additionally, the system only recommended a few movies, and I would have liked to see more options before making a decision. Overall, the recommender system was satisfactory, but there is room for improvement.
