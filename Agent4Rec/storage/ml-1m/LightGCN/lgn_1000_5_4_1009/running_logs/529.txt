RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system was able to suggest a couple of movies that aligned with my preferences for classic movies and intense psychological themes. I appreciated the recommendations for "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" and "Psycho" as they were both engaging and well-suited to my taste. However, I was disappointed with the inclusion of "Annie Hall" as it did not match my preferences. Additionally, the system only provided recommendations for one page, which limited my options. Overall, while the system had some hits, it could have been more diverse and offered a wider range of recommendations.
