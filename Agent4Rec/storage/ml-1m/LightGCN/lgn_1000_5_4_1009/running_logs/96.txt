        Relevant context from user 96's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Groundhog Day, Sabrina, Strictly Ballroom, Moonstruck, among them, I watched ['Groundhog Day', 'Sabrina'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Sabrina', 'Strictly Ballroom'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Splash, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Little Mermaid, The, To Catch a Thief, among them, I watched ['Splash', "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Little Mermaid, The', 'To Catch a Thief'].

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 3: Pretty in Pink, Fish Called Wanda, While You Were Sleeping, Ghostbusters, among them, I watched ['Pretty in Pink', 'While You Were Sleeping'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['While You Were Sleeping', 'Fish Called Wanda'].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 96, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, I found that there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, and I have a limited tolerance for unsatisfied memories. The fact that I disliked multiple movies that were recommended to me on each page indicates that the system did not accurately understand my preferences. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have a strong preference for movies that align with my specific tastes, and I did not find enough variety or diversity in the recommendations. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 4.
