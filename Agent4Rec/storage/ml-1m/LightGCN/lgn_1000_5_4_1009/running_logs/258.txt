RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and watch movies infrequently. Despite this, the system recommended movies that did not align with my preferences, such as "Shakespeare in Love" and "Schindler's List," which I disliked. The system also did not take into account my enjoyment of movies with a mix of genres, compelling storytelling, adventure and excitement, and thought-provoking themes. Additionally, the system did not consider my preference for a mix of classic and contemporary films. Overall, the recommendations were not tailored to my selective viewing habits and left me unsatisfied.
