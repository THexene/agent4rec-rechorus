        Act as user 673, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did suggest some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows that the system did not take into account my previous interactions and preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough diverse and avant-garde movie recommendations, which is something I value as a Cinematic Trailblazer. Overall, the system failed to consistently meet my expectations and provide satisfactory recommendations.
