        Act as user 998, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Blues Brothers, The" and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," the majority of the movies suggested did not appeal to me. I appreciate that the system took into account my personal preferences and historical ratings, but it failed to provide a diverse range of movies that I might enjoy. Additionally, the system did not seem to learn from my dislikes on previous pages, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. Overall, I was not satisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not fully understand my movie preferences.
