        Relevant context from user 135's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Men in Black (1997), Groundhog Day (1993), Ghost (1990), Forrest Gump (1994), among them, I watched ['Men in Black (1997)', 'Groundhog Day (1993)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Ghost (1990)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), American Beauty (1999), Bug's Life, A (1998), Shakespeare in Love (1998), among them, I watched ["My Best Friend's Wedding (1997)", 'American Beauty (1999)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Shakespeare in Love (1998)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately predict my movie preferences and included movies that I disliked.
        Act as user 135, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my incredibly infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to accurately predict my movie preferences. It recommended movies that I ended up disliking, such as "Ghost (1990)" and "Shakespeare in Love (1998)". Additionally, the system did not take into account my specific movie tastes, such as animated and family-friendly movies, comedy, action and adventure, drama, fantasy and superhero, and coming-of-age and friendship movies. The recommendations were not diverse enough and did not align with my cinematic trailblazer nature. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I was left unsatisfied.
