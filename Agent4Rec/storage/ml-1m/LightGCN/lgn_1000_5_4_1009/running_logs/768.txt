 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and satisfy my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do decide to explore a recommendation system, I expect it to understand my taste and provide me with movies that align with my preferences. However, this recommender system consistently recommended movies that I did not enjoy or appreciate. Despite my conformity trait as a Maverick Critic, where I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste, I still expected the system to suggest movies that would resonate with me. Unfortunately, the majority of the movies recommended did not align with my preferences for dramatic and emotionally impactful, classic and iconic, suspenseful and thrilling, comedy and action, or thought-provoking and critically acclaimed films. The lack of diversity in the recommendations also contributed to my dissatisfaction. Overall, this recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
