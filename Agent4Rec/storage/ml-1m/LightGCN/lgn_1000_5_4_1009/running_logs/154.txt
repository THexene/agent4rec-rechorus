However, I found that most of the movies recommended to me were not to my liking. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones I watched, and the rest were disappointing. This system did not accurately understand my preferences and failed to provide me with satisfying recommendations. Therefore, I am not satisfied with this recommender system.
