        Act as user 792, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because it did not meet my expectations as an Occasional Viewer. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This indicates that the system did not take into account my previous interactions and preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer enough diversity in its recommendations, as it kept suggesting movies from the same genres that I had already expressed a dislike for. Overall, the system failed to provide me with new and unique movie options, which is important to me as a Cinematic Trailblazer.
