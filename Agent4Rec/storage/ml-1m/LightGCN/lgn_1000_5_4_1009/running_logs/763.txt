RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because I was not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my diverse movie tastes and occasional viewing habits, the system failed to suggest movies that aligned with my preferences. I only enjoyed a few of the movies recommended, and the majority of them did not appeal to me. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to suggest movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie selection.
