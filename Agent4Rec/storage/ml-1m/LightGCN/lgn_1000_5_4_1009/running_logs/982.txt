- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: GoodFellas (1990), Being John Malkovich (1999), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), L.A. Confidential (1997), among them, I watched ['GoodFellas (1990)', 'Being John Malkovich (1999)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I have already watched and rated most of the movies suggested to me.
        Act as user 982, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the recommendations it provided. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While I appreciate the system suggesting movies that align with my preferred genres and themes, I am disappointed that it did not offer a wider variety of options. The system seemed to rely heavily on historical ratings, which resulted in me being recommended movies that I have already watched and rated. This lack of diversity in the recommendations left me unsatisfied and wanting more. Additionally, the system did not take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits, which further contributed to my dissatisfaction. Overall, I believe the recommender system has potential, but it needs to improve its ability to offer more diverse and tailored recommendations to better cater to users like me.
