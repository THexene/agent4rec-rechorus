Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.

The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings.

        Act as user 758, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not accurately predict my movie preferences based on the movies I have watched and disliked. Despite providing ratings for the movies I watched, the system failed to recommend movies that aligned with my tastes. It recommended movies from genres that I have consistently disliked, such as war movies and thrillers. Additionally, the system did not take into account my preference for romantic dramas, comedy films, and adventure and fantasy movies. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited opportunities to watch movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences. Unfortunately, this system fell short in that aspect.
