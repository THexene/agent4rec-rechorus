        Act as user 670, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations as an Occasional Viewer with specific movie preferences. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which indicates a lack of understanding of my taste. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it repeatedly suggested movies from the same genres that I had already expressed disinterest in. As a result, I did not find the recommendations helpful or tailored to my preferences, leading me to exit the system after browsing just 4 pages.
