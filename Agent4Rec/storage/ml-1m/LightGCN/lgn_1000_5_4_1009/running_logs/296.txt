        Act as user 296, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the recommendations it provided. Despite my specific movie preferences and the system's knowledge of my taste, it failed to consistently recommend movies that aligned with my interests. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones recommended, and the majority of them were not to my liking. As an occasional viewer, I have limited time and patience to explore movies that do not meet my expectations. Therefore, the system's inability to consistently provide satisfying recommendations led to my dissatisfaction.
