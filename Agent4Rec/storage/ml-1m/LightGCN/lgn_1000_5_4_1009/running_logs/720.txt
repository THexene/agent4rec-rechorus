RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to understand my movie preferences and consistently recommended movies that I disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I have specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies, and I expect a recommendation system to take that into account. However, this system seemed to ignore my preferences and recommended movies that did not align with my taste at all. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have a high standard for the movies I watch, and this system did not meet those standards. Overall, the system did not provide me with satisfactory recommendations, leading me to exit the system after browsing just 4 pages.
