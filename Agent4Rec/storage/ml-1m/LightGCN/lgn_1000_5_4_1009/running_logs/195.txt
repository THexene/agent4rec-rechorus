- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 195, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did provide some movie recommendations that aligned with my taste, I found that it often suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This indicates that the system did not effectively take into account my previous ratings and preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer enough diverse and avant-garde movie choices, which is something I value as a Cinematic Trailblazer. Overall, the system failed to consistently meet my expectations and provide satisfactory recommendations.
