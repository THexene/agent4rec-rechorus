        Act as user 723, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and preferences. However, the system recommended movies that did not align with my interests, such as "Cat from Outer Space, The" and "Lake Placid," which I disliked. The system also did not take into account my preference for classic horror movies, comedic films with a touch of romance, 80s and 90s nostalgic movies, thrilling and action-packed movies, and coming-of-age and drama films. Additionally, the system's recommendations were not influenced by my own taste but rather relied on historical ratings, which I completely ignore as a maverick critic. Overall, the lack of personalized and tailored recommendations left me unsatisfied with the system.
