        Act as user 330, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and rarely watch movies. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and rated, which was disappointing. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as most of the suggested movies aligned with my preferred genres. I was hoping for more diverse recommendations that would challenge my usual preferences. Overall, the system failed to capture my interest and did not provide me with new and exciting movie options.
