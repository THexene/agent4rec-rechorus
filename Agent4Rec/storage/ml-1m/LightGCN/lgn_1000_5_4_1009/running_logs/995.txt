        Act as user 995, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6
REASON: While the recommender system did provide some movie recommendations that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows that the system did not fully understand my preferences and failed to provide new and diverse options. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences when making subsequent recommendations. However, I appreciate that the system recommended a mix of popular and critically acclaimed movies, which shows a balance between historical ratings and personal preferences. Overall, the system has room for improvement in understanding my preferences and providing more diverse recommendations.
