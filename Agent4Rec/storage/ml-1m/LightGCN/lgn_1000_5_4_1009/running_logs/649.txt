        Act as user 649, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended a significant number of movies that I did not enjoy. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, and I only have a limited number of movies that I am interested in watching. The system failed to consistently provide me with satisfying recommendations, as I disliked the majority of the movies it suggested. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my specific preferences for action-packed thrillers, suspenseful crime dramas, and sci-fi and fantasy adventures. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not effectively cater to my movie preferences.
