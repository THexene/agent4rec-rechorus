        Act as user 74, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and watch movies infrequently. However, the system did not accurately capture my taste for crime and thriller movies, classic and iconic films, dramatic and emotionally impactful movies, action-packed and suspenseful movies, and well-crafted romantic comedies. The majority of the recommended movies did not align with my preferences, and I ended up disliking most of them. Additionally, the system did not take into account my balanced evaluation approach, as it seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings rather than considering my personal preferences. Overall, the lack of accurate recommendations and the system's failure to understand my movie-watching habits and preferences left me unsatisfied.
