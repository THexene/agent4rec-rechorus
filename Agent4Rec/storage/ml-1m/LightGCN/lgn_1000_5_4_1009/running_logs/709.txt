        Act as user 709, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in exploring movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and personalized recommendations. However, the system failed to do so by suggesting movies that I had already rejected. This lack of attention to my preferences and past interactions makes me question the effectiveness of the system. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its recommendations, which is important for an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer like me. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide a satisfactory user experience.
