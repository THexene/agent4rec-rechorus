        Relevant context from user 315's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Maltese Falcon, The (1941), Touch of Evil (1958), Laura (1944), Key Largo (1948), among them, I watched ['Maltese Falcon, The (1941)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].

- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations.
        Act as user 315, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to provide me with any new recommendations after just two pages. It suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I expect the recommender system to be able to curate a more tailored and diverse selection of movies for me. Additionally, the system did not take into account my affinity for psychological thrillers, classic films, mystery and crime films, thought-provoking dramas, and science fiction, which are important aspects of my movie taste. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with any value, resulting in a low rating of 2.
