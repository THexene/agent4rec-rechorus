        Act as user 308, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to consistently align with my movie taste. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my preferences. However, the system recommended several movies that I disliked, leading to unsatisfied memories. Despite occasionally exploring different genres as a Niche Explorer, the recommendations did not cater to my preferred movie types, such as action-packed thrillers, family-friendly adventures, sci-fi and fantasy classics, suspenseful dramas, and romantic comedies. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and disregard historical ratings. The system's reliance on historical ratings did not resonate with my conformity trait. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and failed to consistently provide satisfactory recommendations.
