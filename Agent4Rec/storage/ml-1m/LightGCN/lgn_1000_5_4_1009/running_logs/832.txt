 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not very satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. I appreciate that the system took into account both historical ratings and my personal preferences, but it seemed to miss the mark in understanding my specific movie preferences. Additionally, the system did not seem to offer enough diversity in its recommendations, as it mostly suggested popular mainstream movies. As an Occasional Viewer, I was hoping for more unique and obscure movie suggestions. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I would rate it a 3 out of 10.
