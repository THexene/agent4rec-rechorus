You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 25 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: A Cinematic Trailblazer, a relentless seeker of the unique and the obscure in the world of movies. The movie choices are so diverse and avant-garde that they defy categorization.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  Action-packed thrillers;  Historical dramas;  Psychological thrillers;  Animated adventures;  War and military films;  Mystery and suspense. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 25, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the recommendations it provided. Despite my diverse taste in movies, the system failed to suggest movies that aligned with my preferences. It recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my movie-watching habits. Additionally, the system did not take into account my low activity trait, as it continued to suggest movies even after I had expressed dissatisfaction with the previous recommendations. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with valuable movie recommendations.
