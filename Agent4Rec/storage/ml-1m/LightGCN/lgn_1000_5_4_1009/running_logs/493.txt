        Act as user 493, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and watch movies infrequently. Despite the system considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, it still recommended movies that did not align with my preferences. The majority of the recommended movies were not to my liking, and I only found a few movies that I enjoyed. This lack of accuracy and understanding of my selective viewing habits left me unsatisfied with the recommendations. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its suggestions, as it repeatedly recommended movies from genres that I am not interested in. Overall, the recommender system did not cater to my unique movie preferences and failed to provide a satisfactory user experience.
