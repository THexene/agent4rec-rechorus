        Act as user 959, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I disliked. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences when generating new recommendations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do explore a recommendation system, I expect it to understand my preferences and provide tailored suggestions. Unfortunately, this system fell short in that aspect.
