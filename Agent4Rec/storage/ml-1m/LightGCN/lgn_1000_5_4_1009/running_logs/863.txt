        Act as user 863, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my specific movie preferences, the majority of the recommended movies did not align with my taste. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones I watched, and the rest were not to my liking. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed dislike for. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have high expectations for movie recommendations, and this system did not meet them.
