        Act as user 100, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. Furthermore, it recommended movies that I had already watched and rated lower than other movies. This shows that the system did not take into account my previous preferences and ratings. As an occasional viewer, I rely on accurate recommendations to make the most of my movie-watching experience. The system's inability to understand my preferences and avoid suggesting movies I have already seen and disliked greatly diminishes its usefulness to me.
