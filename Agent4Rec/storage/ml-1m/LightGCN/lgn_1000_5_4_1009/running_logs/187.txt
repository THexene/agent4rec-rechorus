I dislike the rest movies: ['Priest', 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me', 'Poseidon Adventure, The'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new movies that I might be interested in.
        Act as user 187, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and left me unsatisfied. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and infrequent movie-watching habits. However, the recommender system did not take this into account and recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my viewing habits and preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide any new movies that I might be interested in, which further contributed to my dissatisfaction. Overall, the system did not cater to my selective taste and failed to provide me with relevant and intriguing movie recommendations.
