RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system provided some movie recommendations that aligned with my preferences, such as action-packed movies, classic movies, and sci-fi/fantasy movies. I appreciated that it suggested movies like Saving Private Ryan, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, and Godfather, which I enjoyed watching and rated positively. However, there were also movies like Total Recall, French Connection, and American Beauty that I disliked and did not enjoy watching. This inconsistency in the recommendations made me feel unsatisfied with the system. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its suggestions, as it mostly stuck to my preferred movie types. Overall, while the system had some hits, it also had misses, and I would have preferred a more diverse range of recommendations.
