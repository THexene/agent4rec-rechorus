        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide satisfactory recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie tastes and infrequent movie-watching habits. However, the recommender system did not take this into account and continued to suggest movies that I had already expressed dislike for. It also did not offer any new recommendations based on my preferences after browsing through multiple pages. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and not historical ratings, but the system seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings in its recommendations. Overall, the system did not understand my unique preferences and failed to provide personalized and diverse recommendations.
