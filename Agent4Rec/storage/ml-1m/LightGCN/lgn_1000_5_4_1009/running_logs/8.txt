REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and watch movies infrequently. The system should have taken into account my previous ratings and dislikes to provide more tailored recommendations. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its recommendations, repeatedly suggesting movies that were not aligned with my preferences. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not meet my needs as a viewer.
