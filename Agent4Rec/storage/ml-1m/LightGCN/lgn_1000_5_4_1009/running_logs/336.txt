 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, the system consistently recommended movies that I disliked, such as Magnolia, Repo Man, Perfect Storm, and Requiem for a Dream. Despite watching a few movies and giving them a rating of 4, the majority of the recommendations did not align with my interests. This lack of alignment made me feel unsatisfied with the system's suggestions. Additionally, the system did not take into account my diverse movie preferences, as it mainly recommended popular and mainstream films. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not cater to my unique movie taste, resulting in a low rating of 2.
