        Act as user 963, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because I am extremely unsatisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my specific movie tastes and preferences, the majority of the recommended movies did not align with my interests. I found myself disliking most of the movies that I watched based on the system's recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences. However, this system failed to do so, resulting in a disappointing experience. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I do not rely on historical ratings, but this system seemed to heavily consider them in its recommendations, which further contributed to the mismatch in movie choices. Overall, this recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations.
