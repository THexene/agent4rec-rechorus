        Act as user 376, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide satisfactory recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, the recommender system repeatedly suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my viewing habits and preferences. Additionally, the system did not take into account my diverse taste in movies, as it continued to recommend movies that were similar to the ones I had already watched and disliked. Overall, the system did not effectively cater to my unique movie preferences and failed to provide me with relevant and appealing recommendations.
