 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system provided some good recommendations that aligned with my taste for science fiction and fantasy movies, psychological thrillers, and crime and mystery movies. I appreciated that it also included classic and older movies in its suggestions. However, I was not completely satisfied with the system because it recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows that it did not fully understand my preferences and failed to provide me with new and diverse options. Additionally, the system did not take into account my ratings and preferences when suggesting movies, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. Overall, while the system had some positive aspects, it could be improved to better cater to my specific tastes and preferences.
