        Act as user 696, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and watch movies infrequently. The system failed to understand my preferences and recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of personalization and understanding of my unique movie-watching habits. Additionally, the system's reliance on historical ratings and disregard for my Maverick Critic conformity trait further contributed to my dissatisfaction. I was hoping for a more tailored and diverse selection of movies that would align with my selective taste. Overall, the recommender system fell short in providing me with relevant and satisfying movie recommendations.
