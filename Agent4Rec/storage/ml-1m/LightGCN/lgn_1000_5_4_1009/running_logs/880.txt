        Relevant context from user 880's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Matrix, The (1999), X-Men (2000), Fifth Element, The (1997), Powder (1995), among them, I watched ['Matrix, The (1999)', 'X-Men (2000)', 'Fifth Element, The (1997)'] and rate them ['4', '4', '3'] respectively.

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), Titan A.E. (2000), Jurassic Park (1993), Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997), among them, I watched ['Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)', 'Titan A.E. (2000)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Jurassic Park (1993)', 'Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations.
        Act as user 880, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide me with new and satisfying movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my movie-watching habits and preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations beyond the first two pages, which further added to my dissatisfaction. Overall, the system did not effectively cater to my selective and discerning movie tastes, resulting in a disappointing experience.
