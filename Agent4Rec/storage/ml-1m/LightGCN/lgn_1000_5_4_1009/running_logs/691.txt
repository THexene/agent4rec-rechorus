        Act as user 691, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to understand my movie preferences and consistently recommended movies that I disliked. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, I had high hopes that the system would be able to suggest films that align with my taste for classic comedies, satirical films, crime and heist movies, and independent and unconventional films. However, it repeatedly suggested movies from genres that I have no interest in, such as sci-fi and adventure. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed dislike for. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more personalized and accurate recommendation experience, but unfortunately, this system fell short.
