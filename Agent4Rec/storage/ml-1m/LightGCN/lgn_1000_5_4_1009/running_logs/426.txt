RATING: 3
REASON: Although the recommender system provided me with a variety of movie recommendations, I found that the majority of the movies suggested did not align with my personal preferences. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommendations to be tailored to my specific tastes. While I appreciate the system's attempt to offer diverse and unique options, it failed to consistently suggest movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, the conformity aspect of the system, which considers historical ratings, sometimes led to recommendations that did not resonate with me. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and therefore rate the recommender system a 3.
