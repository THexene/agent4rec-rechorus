        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: Although the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, I found that a significant number of the recommended movies were not to my liking. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommendations to be spot-on. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and disregard historical ratings. However, it seems that the recommender system heavily relies on historical ratings, which resulted in some movies being recommended to me that I did not enjoy. Furthermore, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I expect the recommendations to be meticulously curated to match my personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety. Unfortunately, the recommender system failed to meet this expectation. Overall, while the system did have some hits, the misses and lack of personalization make me unsatisfied with the recommender system.
