        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to satisfy my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste, which includes action-packed, classic, suspenseful, romantic, adventure, and dramatic genres. However, the system recommended movies that did not meet my criteria, resulting in a majority of movies that I disliked. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the system did not accurately capture my movie taste. Additionally, the system did not provide enough diversity in its recommendations, as it kept suggesting popular mainstream movies that did not align with my preference for unique and obscure films. Therefore, I am not satisfied with this recommender system.
