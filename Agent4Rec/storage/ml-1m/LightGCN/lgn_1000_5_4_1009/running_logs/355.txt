- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations.
        Act as user 355, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because I am extremely unsatisfied with the recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I rarely watch movies, so when I do, I expect the recommendations to be tailored to my unique taste and preferences. However, this system failed to do so. It recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, it did not offer any new or diverse recommendations that align with my love for thought-provoking and character-driven films. Overall, this recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with any valuable movie suggestions.
