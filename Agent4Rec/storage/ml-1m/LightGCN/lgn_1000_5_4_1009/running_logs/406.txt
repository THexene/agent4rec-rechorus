        Relevant context from user 406's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Moonstruck, A Man and a Woman, Shakespeare in Love, Casablanca, among them, I watched ['Moonstruck', 'Casablanca'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['A Man and a Woman'].

I dislike the rest movies: ['Philadelphia Story, The'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them to me.
        Act as user 406, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my preferences, it failed to take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences, and I expect the recommender system to respect that. The system's lack of consideration for my dislikes shows a lack of understanding and personalization, which greatly diminishes my satisfaction with the system.
