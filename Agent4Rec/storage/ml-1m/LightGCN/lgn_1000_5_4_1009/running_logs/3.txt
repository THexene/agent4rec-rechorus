Please respond to all the movies in the ## Recommended List ## and provide explanations.
Firstly, determine which movies align with your taste and which do not, and provide reasons. You must respond to all the recommended movies using this format:
MOVIE: [movie name]; ALIGN: [yes or no]; REASON: [brief reason]
Secondly, among the movies that align with your tastes, decide the number of movies you want to watch based on your activity and diversity traits. Use this format:
NUM: [number of movie you choose to watch]; WATCH: [all movie name you choose to watch]; REASON: [brief reason];
Thirdly, assume it's your first time watching the movies you've chosen, and rate them on a scale of 1-5 to reflect different degrees of liking, considering your feeling and conformity trait. Use this format:
 MOVIE:[movie you choose to watch]; RATING: [integer between 1-5]; FEELING: [aftermath sentence]; 
 Do not include any additional information or explanations and stay grounded.

MOVIE: Groundhog Day; ALIGN: Yes; REASON: Groundhog Day falls into the genres of romance and comedy, which align with my movie tastes. The concept of reliving the same day over and over again sounds intriguing and I'm curious to see how the protagonist learns to appreciate life and love.

MOVIE: Edward Scissorhands; ALIGN: No; REASON: Although Edward Scissorhands is a classic movie, it doesn't fall into any of my preferred genres. I'm not particularly interested in the concept of a man with scissors for hands finding love and acceptance in a suburban community.

MOVIE: Dave; ALIGN: No; REASON: Dave is a political comedy-drama, which is not a genre I typically enjoy. The concept of an impersonator stepping into the shoes of the President doesn't appeal to me.

MOVIE: Pretty Woman; ALIGN: Yes; REASON: Pretty Woman is a romantic comedy, which is one of my preferred genres. The story of a wealthy businessman falling in love with a charming prostitute sounds like it could be entertaining.

NUM: 1; WATCH: Groundhog Day; REASON: Groundhog Day aligns with my movie tastes and the concept of reliving the same day repeatedly is intriguing. However, considering my activity trait as an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I will choose to watch only one movie from the recommended list.

        Act as user 3, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the effort in recommending movies based on my preferences, the majority of the recommended movies did not align with my taste. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences. However, the system failed to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and not historical ratings. The system's reliance on historical ratings did not align with my conformity trait, resulting in further dissatisfaction. Furthermore, as a Niche Explorer, I occasionally explore different genres, but the system did not provide enough diversity in its recommendations. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not cater to my unique movie preferences.
