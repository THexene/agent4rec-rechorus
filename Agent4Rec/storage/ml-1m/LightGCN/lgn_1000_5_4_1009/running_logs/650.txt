        Act as user 650, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I did not enjoy. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited patience for recommendations that do not consistently match my preferences. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have a high standard for the movies I choose to watch, and this system did not consistently meet that standard. The conformity trait of the system, relying heavily on historical ratings, may have contributed to the lack of variety in the recommendations. Overall, I did not feel satisfied with the recommender system and decided to leave after browsing just three pages.
