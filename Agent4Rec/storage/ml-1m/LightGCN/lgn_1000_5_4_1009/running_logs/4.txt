You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as a user exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  have a taste for action-packed movies.;  enjoy comedy movies.;  appreciate suspenseful thrillers.;  have a liking for buddy cop movies.;  am a fan of sports dramas.. 
And your rating tendency is  I tend to give high ratings to action-packed movies, comedies, suspenseful thrillers, buddy cop movies, and sports dramas. These genres captivate me and provide me with entertainment, excitement, and laughter.
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Relevant context from user 4's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Gladiator (2000), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), Peacemaker, The (1997), U-571 (2000), among them, I watched ['Gladiator (2000)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively.

- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Lethal Weapon 3 (1992), X-Men (2000), Conspiracy Theory (1997), U.S. Marshalls (1998), among them, I watched ['Lethal Weapon 3 (1992)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['X-Men (2000)', 'Conspiracy Theory (1997)', 'U.S. Marshalls (1998)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked.
        Act as user 4, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it did not accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and watch movies infrequently. The system failed to take into account my preference for action-packed movies, comedy movies, suspenseful thrillers, buddy cop movies, and sports dramas. Instead, it recommended movies like Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), Peacemaker, The (1997), X-Men (2000), Conspiracy Theory (1997), and U.S. Marshalls (1998), which do not align with my preferences at all. Despite rating the movies I did watch accurately, the system did not improve its recommendations and continued to suggest movies that I had no interest in. This lack of understanding and failure to adapt to my preferences left me unsatisfied with the recommender system.
