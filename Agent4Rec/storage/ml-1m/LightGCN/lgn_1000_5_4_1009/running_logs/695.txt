        Relevant context from user 695's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Arachnophobia (1990), American Beauty (1999), Blair Witch Project, The (1999), Thomas Crown Affair, The (1999), among them, I watched ['American Beauty (1999)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively.

- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Double Jeopardy (1999), Gladiator (2000), Payback (1999), Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), among them, I watched ['Double Jeopardy (1999)', 'Gladiator (2000)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Payback (1999)', 'Gone in 60 Seconds (2000)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately understand my preferences as I disliked several of the recommended movies.
        Act as user 695, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not accurately understand my preferences. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, the system failed to recommend movies that aligned with my preferences. It recommended movies like "Arachnophobia" and "Blair Witch Project" which I clearly stated I disliked. Additionally, the system did not take into account my preference for action-packed movies with intense plots, thought-provoking and unconventional films, sci-fi and fantasy movies, movies with a mix of comedy and adventure, emotionally impactful dramas, and suspenseful thrillers with unexpected twists. Instead, it recommended movies that did not match my preferences at all. As a maverick critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and not historical ratings, so the system's reliance on historical ratings did not provide me with accurate recommendations. Furthermore, as an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I expect the system to curate movies that match my taste and leave no room for variety. Unfortunately, the system failed to meet this expectation. Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system as it did not understand my preferences and failed to provide accurate recommendations.
