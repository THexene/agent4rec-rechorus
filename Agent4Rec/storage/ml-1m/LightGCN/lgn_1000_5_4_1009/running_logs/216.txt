        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While I appreciate the effort of the recommender system in providing movie recommendations, I am not entirely satisfied with the results. The system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Fugitive, The" and "Professional, The (a.k.a. Leon: The Professional)", which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, the majority of the recommended movies were not to my liking, and I ended up disliking them. Additionally, the system seemed to overlook the fact that I had already watched and disliked certain movies, as it continued to recommend them to me. This lack of personalization and attention to my previous ratings and preferences left me feeling unsatisfied with the recommender system.
