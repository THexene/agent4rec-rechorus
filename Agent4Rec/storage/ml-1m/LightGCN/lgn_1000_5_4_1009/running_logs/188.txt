        Act as user 188, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my taste, the majority of the recommendations did not align with my preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in exploring movies that do not strictly align with my taste. The system's inability to consistently recommend movies that I enjoy resulted in a frustrating experience. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I do not rely on historical ratings, so the system's reliance on them did not resonate with me. Overall, the lack of satisfaction in the movie recommendations and the system's failure to understand my unique preferences led to a low rating.
