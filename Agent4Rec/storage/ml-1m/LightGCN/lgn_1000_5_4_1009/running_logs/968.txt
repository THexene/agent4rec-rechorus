I dislike the rest movies: ['Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)', 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Talented Mr. Ripley, The (1999), Rushmore (1998), Simple Plan, A (1998), Thomas Crown Affair, The (1999), among them, I watched ['Talented Mr. Ripley, The (1999)', 'Thomas Crown Affair, The (1999)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Rushmore (1998)', 'Simple Plan, A (1998)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately predict my preferences and I disliked most of the recommended movies.
        Act as user 968, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not accurately predict my preferences and I disliked most of the recommended movies. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and rarely watch movies. However, when I do watch a movie, I expect the recommender system to understand my preferences and recommend movies that align with them. Unfortunately, this system failed to do so. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. But the system did not take this into account and recommended movies that I did not enjoy. Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommendations and would not rely on this system in the future.
