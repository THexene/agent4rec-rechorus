        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: Although the recommender system did suggest some movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," I was not completely satisfied with the overall recommendations. The system failed to provide enough variety and did not offer any movies outside of my preferred genres of action-packed, historical dramas, sci-fi adventures, war films, thrillers, and musical dramas. Additionally, the system did not take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits, which made it difficult for me to find movies that truly piqued my interest. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 4.
