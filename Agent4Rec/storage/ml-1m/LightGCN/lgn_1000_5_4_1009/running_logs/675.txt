        Act as user 675, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer. The system recommended movies that were not aligned with my movie tastes, and I ended up disliking the majority of the recommended movies. Despite exploring three pages, I did not find any movies that truly interested me. The system did not take into account my preference for Sci-Fi/Fantasy, Action/Adventure, and 80s Nostalgia movies, and instead recommended movies from different genres that I had no interest in. Additionally, the system did not consider my Maverick Critic trait, as it relied heavily on historical ratings rather than evaluating movies solely based on my own taste. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and had to exit the system.
