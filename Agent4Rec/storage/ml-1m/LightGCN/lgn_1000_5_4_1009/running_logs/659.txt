        Relevant context from user 659's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Wayne's World, Dumb & Dumber, Bug's Life, A, among them, I watched ['Dumb & Dumber'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', "Wayne's World", "Bug's Life, A"].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Pretty Woman, Men in Black, Back to the Future Part III, Airplane II: The Sequel, among them, I watched ['Pretty Woman', 'Men in Black'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Back to the Future Part III', 'Airplane II: The Sequel'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately predict my preferences and suggested movies that I disliked.
        Act as user 659, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 out of 10. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Dumb & Dumber" and "Pretty Woman", it also suggested movies that I clearly stated I disliked, such as "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" and "Back to the Future Part III". As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited patience for recommendations that do not accurately predict my preferences. The system failed to understand my specific movie tastes and did not provide me with a satisfactory experience.
