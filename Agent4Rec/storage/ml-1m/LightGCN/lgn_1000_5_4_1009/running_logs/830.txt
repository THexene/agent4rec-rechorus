        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, the system recommended a majority of movies that I disliked or had no interest in watching. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the system still failed to accurately understand my movie preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety or options that aligned with my taste for romantic comedies, dark and twisted films, coming-of-age stories, quirky and offbeat movies, and classic and nostalgic films. Overall, the recommender system did not cater to my selective viewing habits and left me feeling unsatisfied.
