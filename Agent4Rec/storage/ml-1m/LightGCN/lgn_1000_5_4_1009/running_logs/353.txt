 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the majority of the recommended movies did not match my preferences. Despite watching and rating a few movies positively, such as "Shakespeare in Love" and "Good Will Hunting," I disliked the majority of the movies suggested to me. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my movie preferences. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have a very specific taste in movies, and the system failed to provide me with a diverse range of options. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations, and I am not satisfied with the results it provided.
