RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system had some positive aspects, such as recommending movies that aligned with my taste in action-packed thrillers, classic films, war and historical dramas, crime and mystery films, and epic adventures. I appreciated that it took into account my personal preferences and historical ratings when making recommendations. However, I was not completely satisfied with the system because it often recommended movies that I had already expressed dislike for, and it did not provide enough new recommendations based on my preferences. Additionally, the system did not seem to understand my preference for diverse and avant-garde films, as it mainly recommended well-known and mainstream movies. Overall, while the system had some strengths, it could be improved to better cater to my specific movie tastes and provide more diverse recommendations.
