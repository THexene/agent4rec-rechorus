        Act as user 88, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. While I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my taste, the majority of the movies recommended to me did not align with my preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, and I have a high level of selectivity when it comes to the movies I choose to watch. The system failed to understand my specific preferences for intense and action-packed movies, sci-fi and fantasy movies, comedies with a touch of romance, suspenseful and thrilling movies, crime and drama movies, movies with a mix of action and adventure, movies with a twist or unconventional storytelling, thriller and mystery movies, and superhero and comic book movies. The recommendations were not tailored enough to my taste, and as a result, I only enjoyed a few of the movies I watched. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not seem to take this into account. Overall, the lack of alignment with my taste and the limited satisfaction I derived from the recommended movies lead me to rate this recommender system a 3 out of 10.
