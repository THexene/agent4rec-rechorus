        Act as user 222, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my diverse taste, I was unsatisfied with the fact that it also suggested movies that I disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and it is disappointing when the system recommends movies that do not meet my criteria. Additionally, as a dedicated follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, so it would have been better if the system took that into consideration and recommended movies with higher historical ratings. Overall, the system did not fully meet my expectations and I was left unsatisfied with the movie recommendations.
