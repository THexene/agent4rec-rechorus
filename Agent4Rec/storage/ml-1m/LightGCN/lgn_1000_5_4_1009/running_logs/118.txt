You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 118 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Occasional Viewer, seldom attracted by movie recommendations. Only curious about watching movies that strictly align the taste. The movie-watching habits are not very infrequent. And you tend to exit the recommender system if you have a few unsatisfied memories.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy animated movies.;  like romantic comedies.;  appreciate thought-provoking dramas.;  have a preference for classic movies.;  enjoy independent films.;  like coming-of-age stories.;  enjoy movies with a historical or period setting.;  appreciate dark and unconventional films.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations and failed to provide accurate recommendations based on my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do decide to explore them, I expect the recommendations to align closely with my taste. However, this recommender system suggested several movies that I disliked, such as "Being John Malkovich," "American Pie," "Erin Brockovich," "Gladiator," "Strictly Ballroom," "Romy and Michele's High School Reunion," "Runaway Bride," "Office Space," and "Blair Witch Project." These movies do not align with my preferences for animated movies, romantic comedies, thought-provoking dramas, classic movies, independent films, coming-of-age stories, movies with a historical or period setting, and dark and unconventional films. 

Additionally, the recommender system did not provide any new recommendations based on my preferences after the first few pages. It seemed to be stuck in a loop, suggesting movies that I had already expressed dislike for. This lack of variety and failure to adapt to my preferences further contributed to my dissatisfaction with the system.

Overall, this recommender system did not effectively cater to my selective viewing habits and failed to provide accurate recommendations that aligned with my taste. Therefore, I rate it a 3.
