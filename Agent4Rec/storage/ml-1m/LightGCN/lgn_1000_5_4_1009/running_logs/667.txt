        Relevant context from user 667's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Saving Private Ryan, Terminator, The, Rock, The, Heat, among them, I watched ['Saving Private Ryan', 'Terminator, The'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Heat'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Jurassic Park, Hunt for Red October, The, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Matrix, The, among them, I watched ['Jurassic Park', 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Hunt for Red October, The'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I disliked some of the movies recommended to me.
        Act as user 667, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 out of 10. While it did recommend a couple of movies that I enjoyed, such as "Saving Private Ryan" and "Terminator, The", there were also movies that I disliked, like "Heat" and "Hunt for Red October, The". As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and it's important for a recommender system to accurately understand and cater to those preferences. Unfortunately, this system failed to do so, resulting in a less than satisfactory experience for me. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, and it seems like this system did not take that into account. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and would have preferred a more personalized and accurate selection of movies.
