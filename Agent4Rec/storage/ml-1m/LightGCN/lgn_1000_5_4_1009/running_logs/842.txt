        Act as user 842, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my preferred genres, the recommendations did not align with my taste. I am an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, and the system failed to understand my infrequent movie-watching habits. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I do not conform to historical ratings, yet the system heavily relied on them. This resulted in recommendations that did not resonate with my personal preferences. Furthermore, the system did not offer enough diversity in its recommendations, as it mostly suggested movies within my preferred genres. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations.
