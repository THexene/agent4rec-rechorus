REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific and diverse movie tastes, including being a Sci-Fi Enthusiast, Action Lover, Classic Fan, and Romantic at Heart. However, the system failed to recommend movies that aligned with my preferences. The movies recommended to me were mostly mainstream and did not cater to my unique and avant-garde taste.

I was unsatisfied with the majority of the movies suggested to me and had to exit the system after browsing just three pages. Overall, the recommender system did not effectively cater to my movie preferences and failed to provide me with satisfying recommendations.
