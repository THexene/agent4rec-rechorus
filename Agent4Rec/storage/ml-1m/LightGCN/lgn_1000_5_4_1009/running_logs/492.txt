- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: My Cousin Vinny, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, among them, I watched ['My Cousin Vinny', "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I have already watched and rated most of the movies suggested to me.
        Act as user 492, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific and diverse movie tastes. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, such as Apocalypse Now and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, it also suggested movies like Airplane! and Addams Family, which I did not enjoy. Additionally, the system failed to provide me with enough new and unique movie options that I haven't already seen or rated. Overall, the recommendations were not tailored enough to my specific tastes and did not offer enough diversity in movie choices.
