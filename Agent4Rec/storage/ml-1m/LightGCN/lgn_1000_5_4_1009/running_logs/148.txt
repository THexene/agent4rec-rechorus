RATING: 4
REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations as an Occasional Viewer. While it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, such as Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi and Ghostbusters, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and American Beauty. This indicates a lack of personalized recommendations and a failure to understand my preferences.

As a Cinematic Trailblazer, I was hoping for more unique and obscure movie suggestions. Overall, I was not satisfied with the recommender system's performance.
