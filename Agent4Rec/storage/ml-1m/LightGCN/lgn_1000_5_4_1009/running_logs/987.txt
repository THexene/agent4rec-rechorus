        Act as user 987, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my taste, it consistently suggested movies that I disliked on multiple pages. This indicates that the system did not effectively understand my preferences and failed to provide accurate recommendations. As an occasional viewer, I rely on the recommender system to suggest movies that align with my taste, and when it repeatedly suggests movies that I dislike, it diminishes my trust in the system. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its recommendations, as it kept suggesting movies from the same genres and time periods. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations, and I would rate it a 3 out of 10.
