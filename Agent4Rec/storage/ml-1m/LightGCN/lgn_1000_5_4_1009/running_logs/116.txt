        Act as user 116, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the system recommended movies that I had already expressed dislike for in previous pages. This shows that the system did not take into account my preferences and did not learn from my previous ratings. As a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not seem to consider this aspect either. Additionally, as a Niche Explorer, I occasionally explore different genres, but the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations. Overall, the system failed to satisfy my movie preferences and did not provide a personalized experience.
