Please respond to all the movies in the ## Recommended List ## and provide explanations.
Firstly, determine which movies align with your taste and which do not, and provide reasons. You must respond to all the recommended movies using this format:
MOVIE: [movie name]; ALIGN: [yes or no]; REASON: [brief reason]
Secondly, among the movies that align with your tastes, decide the number of movies you want to watch based on your activity and diversity traits. Use this format:
NUM: [number of movie you choose to watch]; WATCH: [all movie name you choose to watch]; REASON: [brief reason];
Thirdly, assume it's your first time watching the movies you've chosen, and rate them on a scale of 1-5 to reflect different degrees of liking, considering your feeling and conformity trait. Use this format:
 MOVIE:[movie you choose to watch]; RATING: [integer between 1-5]; FEELING: [aftermath sentence]; 
 Do not include any additional information or explanations and stay grounded.

MOVIE: Fly II, The (1989); ALIGN: No; REASON: Although I enjoy horror movies, this movie does not align with my taste as it focuses more on genetic enhancement and revenge rather than the supernatural or psychological elements that I prefer.

MOVIE: Star Trek: Generations (1994); ALIGN: No; REASON: I am not a fan of the Star Trek franchise and prefer movies with a more fantastical or otherworldly theme.

MOVIE: Dark Crystal, The (1982); ALIGN: Yes; REASON: This movie aligns with my taste as it falls under the category of fantasy and adventure, which I appreciate. The concept of a young Gelfling going on a perilous journey to restore balance to his world sounds intriguing.

MOVIE: 2010 (1984); ALIGN: No; REASON: While I enjoy science fiction movies, this movie does not align with my taste as it focuses on a mission to investigate the disappearance of a spacecraft rather than exploring futuristic concepts or technologies.

NUM: 1; WATCH: Dark Crystal, The (1982); REASON: Since I have already watched and rated most of the recommended movies, I will choose to watch only one movie that aligns with my taste to avoid watching movies I have already seen.

MOVIE: Dark Crystal, The (1982); RATING: 4; FEELING: After watching Dark Crystal, The (1982), I was captivated by the visually stunning world and the thrilling journey of the young Gelfling. The movie exceeded my expectations and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

        Act as user 102, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: Although the recommender system provided me with some movie recommendations that aligned with my taste, I found the overall experience to be unsatisfying. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and watch movies infrequently. The system failed to offer a diverse range of options that I haven't already watched or disliked. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I don't rely on historical ratings to evaluate movies, so the system's recommendations based on popular ratings didn't resonate with me. Overall, the system lacked the ability to cater to my highly selective and unique movie taste, resulting in a limited selection and repetitive recommendations.
