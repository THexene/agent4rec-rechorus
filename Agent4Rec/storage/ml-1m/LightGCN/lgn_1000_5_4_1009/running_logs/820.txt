RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to consistently recommend movies that align with my taste. While I did find a few movies that I enjoyed and rated highly, the majority of the recommended movies were not to my liking. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited patience for unsatisfactory recommendations, and after browsing through 5 pages, I decided to leave the system. The lack of variety and the failure to consistently understand my preferences left me feeling dissatisfied with the overall experience.
