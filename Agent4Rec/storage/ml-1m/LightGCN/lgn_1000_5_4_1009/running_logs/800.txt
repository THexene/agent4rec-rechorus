        Act as user 800, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my quirky and offbeat taste, it also suggested movies that I explicitly disliked. Additionally, the system did not provide any new recommendations based on my preferences after browsing through multiple pages. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and diverse selection of movies that would pique my interest. The conformity trait of the system, heavily relying on historical ratings, did not align with my cinematic trailblazer nature. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 4.
