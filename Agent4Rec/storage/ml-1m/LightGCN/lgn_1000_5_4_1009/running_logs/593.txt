- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I disliked and only a few movies that I enjoyed.

        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my incredibly infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to provide me with a satisfactory selection of movies. It recommended movies that I clearly stated I disliked, and only a few movies that I actually enjoyed. The system did not take into account my preferences for classic horror, science fiction, cult movies, suspenseful and psychological thrillers, and black and white movies. Additionally, the recommendations were not diverse enough to offer me any variety in my movie choices. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not cater to my unique movie tastes.
