        Act as user 973, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, I was open to exploring new movies. However, the system repeatedly suggested movies that I had already expressed dislike for in previous pages. This lack of personalization and failure to consider my preferences made the recommendations irrelevant and frustrating. As an elusive occasional viewer, I rely heavily on the recommender system to suggest movies that align with my diverse taste, but it fell short in this regard. The system needs to improve its understanding of my preferences and avoid suggesting movies that I have already expressed disinterest in.
