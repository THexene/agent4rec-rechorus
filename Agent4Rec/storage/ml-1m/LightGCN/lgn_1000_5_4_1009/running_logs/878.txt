        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and satisfy my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I was curious to see if this system could align with my taste. However, the recommendations provided did not match my interests in sci-fi and fantasy, classic movies, adventure and action films, thought-provoking and philosophical movies, historical and war films, comedy, and movies with a mix of drama and romance. The system mainly suggested movies that I disliked, such as Full Metal Jacket, The Fugitive, Amadeus, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Mad Max, and Raising Arizona. The lack of alignment with my diverse and avant-garde taste left me unsatisfied. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the exploration of unique and obscure movies that I enjoy as a Cinematic Trailblazer. Overall, this recommender system did not cater to my preferences and failed to provide me with satisfying movie recommendations.
