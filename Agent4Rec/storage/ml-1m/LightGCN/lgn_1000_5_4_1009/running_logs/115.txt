- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them to me.

        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and it is important for the recommender system to respect those preferences. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, so it would have been beneficial if the system had considered my previous ratings and tailored the recommendations accordingly. The lack of personalization and consideration for my preferences left me unsatisfied with the system.
