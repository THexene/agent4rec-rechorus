        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my tastes, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, so it is important for the system to provide accurate and personalized suggestions. However, the system failed to meet my expectations by suggesting movies that I had already seen and did not enjoy. This lack of satisfaction led me to exit the recommender system after browsing just 4 pages.
