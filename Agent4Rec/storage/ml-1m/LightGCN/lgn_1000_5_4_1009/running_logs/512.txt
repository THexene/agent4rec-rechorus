        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do decide to explore, I expect the recommendations to strictly align with my taste. However, this system recommended movies that I did not enjoy on multiple occasions. This lack of satisfaction led me to exit the recommender system after browsing just three pages. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but this system did not seem to take that into account. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide accurate recommendations based on my preferences.
