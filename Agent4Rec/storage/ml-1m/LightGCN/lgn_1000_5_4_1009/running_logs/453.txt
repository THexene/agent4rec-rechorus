I dislike the rest movies: ['Rock, The (1996)', 'Spy Who Loved Me, The (1977)', 'Twister (1996)'].

        Relevant context from user 453's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Cliffhanger (1993), Rock, The (1996), Spy Who Loved Me, The (1977), Twister (1996), among them, I watched ['Cliffhanger (1993)', 'Rock, The (1996)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Rock, The (1996)', 'Spy Who Loved Me, The (1977)', 'Twister (1996)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 453, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended a couple of movies that I enjoyed, the majority of the recommendations did not align with my taste. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences when it comes to movies, and this system failed to understand that. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I do not rely on historical ratings to evaluate movies, so the system's reliance on them did not resonate with me. Lastly, the lack of diversity in the recommendations was disappointing. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I will not be using it again.
