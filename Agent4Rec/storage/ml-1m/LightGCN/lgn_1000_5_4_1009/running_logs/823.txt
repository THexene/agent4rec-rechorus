RATING: 3
REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific and diverse movie tastes. However, the recommendations provided by the system were mostly mainstream and popular movies that did not align with my preferences. Despite watching a few movies and giving ratings based on historical ratings, I still felt unsatisfied with the overall selection. The system failed to capture my love for classic movies with a touch of nostalgia, timeless animated movies, and movies with a mix of drama and mystery. Additionally, the lack of unique and obscure movie recommendations disappointed me as a Cinematic Trailblazer. Overall, the recommender system did not cater to my specific tastes and failed to provide a diverse range of movie options.
