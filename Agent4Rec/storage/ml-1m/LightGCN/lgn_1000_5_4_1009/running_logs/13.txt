- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the system did not take into account my dislike for the movie "Alien (1979)" and continued to recommend it to me.
        Act as user 13, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to take into account my dislike for the movie "Alien (1979)" and continued to recommend it to me. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and it is important for the recommender system to consider my dislikes as well. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations. It mostly recommended movies from the same genres that I enjoy, but as a Niche Explorer, I occasionally like to explore different genres. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not fully understand my movie preferences.
