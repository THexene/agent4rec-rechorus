        Act as user 897, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to accurately understand my movie preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and infrequent movie-watching habits. While I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my preferred genres and movie types, it did not take into account my dislike for certain movies. Additionally, as a balanced evaluator, I consider both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings. However, the system did not seem to take this into account either, as it continued to recommend movies that did not align with my preferences. Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system's performance in understanding my unique movie tastes and providing accurate recommendations.
