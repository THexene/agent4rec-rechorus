        Act as user 490, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide satisfactory recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, the recommender system did not accurately capture my taste and consistently recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences greatly diminished my satisfaction with the system. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations beyond the initial pages, which further limited its usefulness. Overall, the recommender system did not effectively cater to my unique movie-watching habits and failed to provide me with enjoyable and diverse movie suggestions.
