        Act as user 970, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to consistently provide me with movie recommendations that aligned with my tastes. Despite providing feedback and ratings on the movies I watched, the system did not seem to adapt and improve its recommendations. I disliked one of the movies recommended on the first page and did not find any movies I liked on the second page. This lack of personalization and inability to understand my preferences left me unsatisfied with the system. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its recommendations, as it consistently suggested movies that fell within my preferred genres and themes. As an elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a system that could surprise me with unexpected and diverse movie choices. Unfortunately, this system fell short in that aspect as well. Overall, while the system had some initial promising recommendations, it failed to consistently meet my expectations and provide me with a satisfactory movie selection.
