        Act as user 637, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my tastes, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I do expect the recommendations to strictly align with my taste. The system failed to consistently meet this expectation, resulting in a lower rating. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences further contributed to my dissatisfaction with the system.
