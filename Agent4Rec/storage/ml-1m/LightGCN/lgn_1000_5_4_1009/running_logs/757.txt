You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 757 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Dedicated Follower who gives ratings heavily relies on movie historical ratings, rarely expressing independent opinions. Usually give ratings that are same as historical ratings. 
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  Classic and Romantic;  Drama and Period;  Family and Animation;  Historical and War;  Coming-of-age and Romance. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to provide me with recommendations that aligned with my tastes. I only enjoyed a few of the recommended movies and disliked the majority of them. Additionally, the system did not take into account my selectivity and preference for classic, romantic, drama, period, family, animation, historical, war, and coming-of-age movies. The recommendations were not diverse enough and did not cater to my specific interests. Furthermore, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the variety of movies suggested to me. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations.
