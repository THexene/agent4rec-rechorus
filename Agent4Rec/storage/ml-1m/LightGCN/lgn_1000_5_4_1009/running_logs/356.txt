RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system did an okay job in recommending movies that aligned with my taste. I appreciated that it suggested movies with a sense of adventure and exploration, thrilling and action-packed movies, emotional and dramatic movies, and a mix of comedy and romance. However, I was disappointed that it recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked on multiple occasions.

Additionally, the system did not offer enough diversity in its recommendations, as it mainly suggested classic and timeless movies, which, although I appreciate, did not fully cater to my diverse and avant-garde taste. Overall, the system had some hits and misses, but there is definitely room for improvement.
