- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately predict my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked.

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to accurately predict my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the diversity of movie recommendations. As an elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and diverse selection of movies that aligned with my specific tastes.
