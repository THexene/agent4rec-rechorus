        Relevant context from user 818's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Jurassic Park (1993), X-Men (2000), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Princess Bride, The (1987), among them, I watched ['Jurassic Park (1993)', 'X-Men (2000)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively.

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Total Recall (1990), Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), among them, I watched ['Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)', 'Total Recall (1990)'] and rate them ['5', '4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Lethal Weapon 2 (1989)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I have already watched and rated most of the recommended movies, leaving me with limited options to explore.
        Act as user 818, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 out of 10. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my diverse taste, the overall experience left me unsatisfied. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and watch movies infrequently. The system failed to understand this and recommended movies that I had already watched and rated. This limited my options for exploration and left me feeling disappointed. Additionally, the system did not provide enough unique and obscure movie recommendations that I crave as a cinematic trailblazer. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not cater to my unique movie-watching habits and preferences.
