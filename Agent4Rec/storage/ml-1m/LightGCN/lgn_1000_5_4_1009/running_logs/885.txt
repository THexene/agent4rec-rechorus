        Act as user 885, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I disliked. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in the recommendations. I was hoping to discover new movies that I might enjoy, but the system seemed to only suggest movies from a limited pool. As an occasional viewer, I rely heavily on the recommender system to provide me with accurate and diverse recommendations, and unfortunately, this system fell short in meeting my expectations.
