I dislike the rest movies: ['Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the system continued to recommend movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 599, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the recommendations it provided. Despite my diverse taste in movies and my preference for thought-provoking dramas and historical films, the system continued to recommend popular mainstream movies like Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars, which do not align with my preferences. Additionally, the system failed to take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I expect the recommender system to understand my unique preferences and provide me with more obscure and diverse movie choices. Unfortunately, this system fell short in meeting my expectations.
