        Act as user 949, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did suggest some movies that aligned with my preferences, I found that I disliked a significant number of the recommended movies. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and appealing recommendations. However, the system failed to consistently suggest movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I appreciate diversity in movie choices, but the system seemed to focus more on popular and mainstream films rather than offering unique and obscure options. Therefore, I am not entirely satisfied with the recommender system and would rate it a 4 out of 10.
