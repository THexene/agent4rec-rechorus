        Relevant context from user 712's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, American Beauty, Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, among them, I watched ['Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi', 'Back to the Future'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively.

I dislike the rest movies: ['Being John Malkovich (1999)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately predict my preferences based on the movies I watched and disliked.
        Act as user 712, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my preferences, it failed to accurately predict my tastes. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and enjoyed, which is a positive aspect. However, it also suggested movies that I had previously disliked, indicating a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer any new or diverse movie recommendations that could have piqued my interest. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and accurate recommendation experience.
