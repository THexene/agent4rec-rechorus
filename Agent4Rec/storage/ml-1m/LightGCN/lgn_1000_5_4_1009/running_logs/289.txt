RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer.

This lack of personalization and repetition of recommendations made me feel unsatisfied with the system. Additionally, the system did not provide any new recommendations after browsing through three pages, which further decreased my satisfaction. Overall, the system did not effectively cater to my infrequent movie-watching habits and failed to provide a satisfactory user experience.
