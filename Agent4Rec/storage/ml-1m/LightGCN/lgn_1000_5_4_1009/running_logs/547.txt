 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: Although the recommender system did suggest a few movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Amadeus" and "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," it also recommended movies that I disliked, such as "Schindler's List" and "American Beauty." As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences. However, the system failed to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, and the system did not consistently align with those ratings. Therefore, I am not fully satisfied with this recommender system.
