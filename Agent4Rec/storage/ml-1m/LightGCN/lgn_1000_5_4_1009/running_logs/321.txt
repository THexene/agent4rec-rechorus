        Relevant context from user 321's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Lake Placid, Bowfinger, General's Daughter, The, Deep Blue Sea, among them, I watched ['Lake Placid', 'Deep Blue Sea'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Deep Blue Sea', 'Bowfinger', "General's Daughter, The"].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Bone Collector, The, Civil Action, A, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, among them, I watched ['Bone Collector, The'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Civil Action, A', "Romy and Michele's High School Reunion", 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations.
        Act as user 321, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite my incredibly infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to provide any new recommendations for me. It suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not take into account my unique taste as a Maverick Critic, as it seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings. Overall, the system did not cater to my elusive movie-watching habits and did not offer any intriguing or offbeat suggestions.
