RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in recommending movies that aligned with my taste, as I enjoyed and rated positively the movies it suggested, such as "Maltese Falcon, The" and "Saving Private Ryan". However, I am not fully satisfied with the system because it also recommended movies that I disliked, such as "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" and "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope". Additionally, after browsing through multiple pages, the system did not provide any new recommendations based on my previous preferences, which was disappointing. Overall, while the system had some hits, it also had misses and lacked the ability to adapt and provide fresh recommendations.
