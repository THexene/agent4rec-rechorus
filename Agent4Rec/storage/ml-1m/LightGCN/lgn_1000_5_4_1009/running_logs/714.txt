        Act as user 714, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I was curious to see if this system could suggest movies that strictly align with my taste. However, I found that the recommendations were not tailored enough to my preferences. While I did enjoy a few movies that were recommended, such as "Sixth Sense" and "Office Space," the majority of the suggested movies were not to my liking. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my preferences for movies with a thrilling and suspenseful atmosphere, complex and thought-provoking themes, nostalgic and coming-of-age films, a mix of comedy and adventure, strong performances and character development, and a sci-fi or fantasy element. Additionally, the system did not take into account my dislike for certain genres, such as "Bowfinger" and "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me." Overall, the recommendations were not personalized enough and did not align with my specific movie tastes, leading to my dissatisfaction with the system.
