I dislike the rest movies: ['Wedding Singer, The (1998)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 989, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and infrequent movie-watching habits. However, the system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my preferences and a failure to provide me with new and diverse movie options. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I do not conform to historical ratings, yet the system seemed to heavily rely on them in its recommendations. Overall, the system did not cater to my unique movie preferences and did not offer any new or exciting options for me to explore.
