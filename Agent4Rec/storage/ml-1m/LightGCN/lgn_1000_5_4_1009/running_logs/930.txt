        Relevant context from user 930's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Poseidon Adventure, The (1972), Guns of Navarone, The (1961), Captain Horatio Hornblower (1951), Spy Who Loved Me, The (1977), among them, I watched ['Poseidon Adventure, The (1972)', 'Guns of Navarone, The (1961)', 'Captain Horatio Hornblower (1951)'] and rate them ['4', '4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Captain Horatio Hornblower (1951)', 'Spy Who Loved Me, The (1977)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Hunt for Red October, The (1990), Force 10 from Navarone (1978), Dirty Dozen, The (1967), Man with the Golden Gun, The (1974), among them, I watched ['Hunt for Red October, The (1990)', 'Force 10 from Navarone (1978)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Force 10 from Navarone (1978)', 'Man with the Golden Gun, The (1974)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 930, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my preferences, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited opportunities to watch movies, so it is disappointing to see recommendations that do not take into account my previous interactions with the system. Additionally, the system did not offer enough diversity in its recommendations, as it mainly focused on popular and well-known movies. I was hoping for more unique and obscure choices that would cater to my cinematic trailblazer trait. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and failed to provide a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
