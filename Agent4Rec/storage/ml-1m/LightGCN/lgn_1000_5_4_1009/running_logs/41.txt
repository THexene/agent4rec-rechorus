        Act as user 41, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, it failed to take into account my dislikes. The system continued to suggest movies that I had already expressed dislike for, such as 'Total Recall' on page 3 and page 4. This lack of personalization and attention to my preferences made the recommendations less useful for me. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in the recommendations, repeatedly suggesting movies from the same genres. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more diverse range of movie options to choose from. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
