However, the recommender system failed to provide me with a diverse range of movie recommendations that aligned with my preferences. It mainly suggested movies that I had already seen or disliked, and did not offer enough variety in the recommendations. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the exploration of new and potentially interesting movies. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not cater to my unique movie-watching habits and preferences.
