        Act as user 80, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my tastes, it failed to provide enough variety in the recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping to discover new movies that I may not have considered before. However, the system consistently suggested movies that I had already indicated disliking. Additionally, the recommendations seemed to be limited to a narrow range of genres, which did not cater to my diverse movie preferences. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and left me unsatisfied.
