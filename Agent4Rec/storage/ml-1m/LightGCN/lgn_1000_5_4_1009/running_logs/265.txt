RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system had some hits and misses. While it recommended movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "Chinatown," "Blade Runner," and "Pulp Fiction," it also suggested movies that I disliked, like "Godfather, The" and "Jurassic Park." Additionally, I was disappointed that the system did not provide any new recommendations on page 2. However, the system did recommend movies like "L.A.
