        Act as user 42, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because I am incredibly unsatisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my niche preferences for classic science fiction, action, adventure, and fantasy movies, the majority of the recommended movies did not align with my tastes. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to suggest movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences greatly diminished my satisfaction with the system. Furthermore, the infrequency of my movie-watching habits makes it even more crucial for the recommender system to accurately suggest movies that I would enjoy, which unfortunately, it failed to do. Overall, this system did not meet my expectations and left me feeling dissatisfied.
