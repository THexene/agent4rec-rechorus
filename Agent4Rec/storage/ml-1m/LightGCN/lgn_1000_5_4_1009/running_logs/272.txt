        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Back to the Future, Men in Black, Army of Darkness, Bug's Life, A, among them, I watched ['Back to the Future', 'Men in Black'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Army of Darkness'].

        Act as user 272, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I am incredibly unsatisfied with this recommender system. Despite my rare movie-watching habits and unique taste for diverse and avant-garde films, the system failed to provide me with recommendations that aligned with my preferences. The movies suggested on both page 1 and page 2 were mostly mainstream and did not cater to my love for action-packed, sci-fi adventure, comedy, classic, thriller, and quirky films. Additionally, the system ignored my maverick critic trait by relying heavily on historical ratings, which I completely disregard. Overall, this recommender system did not understand my elusive nature as an occasional viewer and failed to provide me with suitable and intriguing movie recommendations.
