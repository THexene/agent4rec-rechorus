        Relevant context from user 174's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: American Beauty, Silence of the Lambs, The, Good Will Hunting, Usual Suspects, The, among them, I watched ['American Beauty', 'Good Will Hunting'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Silence of the Lambs, The'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Life Is Beautiful (La Vita ï¿½ bella), Insider, The, Three Kings, Boys Don't Cry, among them, I watched ['Life Is Beautiful (La Vita ï¿½ bella)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Insider, The', 'Three Kings', "Boys Don't Cry"].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations that matched my preferences.
        Act as user 174, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to provide me with new movie recommendations that matched my preferences. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. I enjoy dark and intense dramas, thought-provoking and artistic films, character-driven and emotionally engaging movies, well-crafted and critically acclaimed movies, as well as documentaries and real-life stories. However, the recommender system only suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. It did not offer any new recommendations that aligned with my preferences. As a result, I found the system to be unsatisfying and unhelpful in finding new movies to watch.
