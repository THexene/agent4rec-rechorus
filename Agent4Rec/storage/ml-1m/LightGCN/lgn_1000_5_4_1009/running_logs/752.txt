        Act as user 752, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and watch movies infrequently. The system recommended movies that I had already indicated I disliked, and it did not offer any new recommendations based on my preferences. Additionally, the system did not take into account my diverse taste in movies, as it consistently suggested movies that were not aligned with my usual preferences. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not effectively cater to my unique movie-watching habits and preferences.
