RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system did a decent job in recommending movies that aligned with my taste. I appreciated that it suggested heartwarming and emotional movies, dark and intense films, comedic and light-hearted movies, suspenseful and thrilling movies, thought-provoking and unconventional films, as well as crime and drama movies. However, I was disappointed that it recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked multiple times. It would have been better if it provided more diverse recommendations instead of repeating the same ones. Overall, the system has room for improvement in terms of avoiding repetitive suggestions and offering a wider range of options.
