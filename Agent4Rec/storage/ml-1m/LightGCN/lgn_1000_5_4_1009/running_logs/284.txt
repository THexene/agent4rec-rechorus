        Relevant context from user 284's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Gladiator (2000), Almost Famous (2000), Cell, The (2000), Sleepy Hollow (1999), among them, I watched ['Gladiator (2000)', 'Almost Famous (2000)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Cell, The (2000)', 'Sleepy Hollow (1999)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Galaxy Quest (1999), Mission to Mars (2000), Toy Story 2 (1999), 13th Warrior, The (1999), among them, I watched ['Galaxy Quest (1999)', 'Toy Story 2 (1999)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Mission to Mars (2000)', '13th Warrior, The (1999)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately predict my preferences and I disliked a significant number of the recommended movies.
        Act as user 284, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not accurately predict my preferences and I disliked a significant number of the recommended movies. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and appealing recommendations. However, the system failed to do so in my case. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the recommendations on both pages did not align well with my movie tastes. I only enjoyed two out of the eight recommended movies and disliked the rest. This lack of accuracy and alignment with my preferences left me unsatisfied with the recommender system.
