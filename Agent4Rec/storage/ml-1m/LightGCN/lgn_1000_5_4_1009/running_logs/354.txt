        Act as user 354, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I am not very satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I clearly disliked. Additionally, after browsing through four pages, the system did not provide any new recommendations, which was disappointing. As an occasional viewer, I have limited time and patience to explore recommendations, so it is important for the system to accurately understand my preferences and provide relevant suggestions. In this case, the system failed to consistently meet my expectations, resulting in a lower rating.
