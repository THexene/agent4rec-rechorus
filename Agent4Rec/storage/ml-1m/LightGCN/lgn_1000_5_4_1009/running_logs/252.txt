 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I do have specific tastes in movies. I enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, suspenseful thrillers, comedy, drama, and action-adventure movies. However, the majority of the movies recommended to me did not align with my preferences. Out of the movies I watched, I only enjoyed a few and disliked the rest. This indicates that the recommender system did not accurately understand my taste and failed to provide me with satisfactory recommendations. Additionally, I found that the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to suggest movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. Overall, the lack of personalized and aligned recommendations led to my dissatisfaction with this recommender system.
