        Act as user 850, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and it is important for the recommender system to respect those preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough diverse and avant-garde movie choices that align with my cinematic trailblazer trait. The recommendations were mostly mainstream movies that did not cater to my unique taste. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not understand my movie-watching habits and preferences.
