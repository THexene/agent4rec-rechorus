RATING: 4
REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer. While I appreciate the diversity of movie recommendations, the majority of the movies suggested did not align with my taste for sci-fi, foreign films, psychological thrillers, and classic movies. I only found two movies that I enjoyed and rated them accordingly. The system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the uniqueness and obscurity I was seeking. Overall, the recommender system failed to capture my elusive movie preferences, resulting in a low rating.
