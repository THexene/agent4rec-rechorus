        Act as user 123, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, the majority of the recommendations were movies that I had already watched and rated. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more diverse selection of movies that I had not yet seen. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the lack of variety and personalization in the recommendations.
