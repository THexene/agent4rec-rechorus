        Act as user 655, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended a significant number of movies that I did not enjoy. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste, and the system failed to consistently provide recommendations that met this criteria. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed dislike for. This lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences left me unsatisfied with the overall experience.
