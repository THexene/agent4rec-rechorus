        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked or did not watch. As an occasional viewer, I have limited time and prefer to watch movies that strictly align with my taste. The system failed to consistently provide recommendations that satisfied my preferences, leading to a lower rating. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations as an Occasional Viewer.
