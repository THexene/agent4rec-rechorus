You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 87 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Occasional Viewer, seldom attracted by movie recommendations. Only curious about watching movies that strictly align the taste. The movie-watching habits are not very infrequent. And you tend to exit the recommender system if you have a few unsatisfied memories.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy classic comedies.;  appreciate thought-provoking dramas.;  have a preference for romantic films.;  enjoy movies with a touch of fantasy or science fiction.;  appreciate historical and war films.;  enjoy sports movies.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 87, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do explore a recommendation system, I expect it to understand my preferences and provide me with movies that I would enjoy. However, in this case, the system failed to do so. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the recommendations did not meet my expectations. The system's inability to accurately predict my movie preferences and consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy led to my dissatisfaction. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have a high level of selectivity when it comes to movie choices, and the lack of variety in the recommendations further contributed to my dissatisfaction. Overall, the system's inability to consistently provide satisfying recommendations and cater to my specific taste resulted in a low rating of 3.
