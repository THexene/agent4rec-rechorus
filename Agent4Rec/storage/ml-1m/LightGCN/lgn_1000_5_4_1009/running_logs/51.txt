You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 51 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Dedicated Follower who gives ratings heavily relies on movie historical ratings, rarely expressing independent opinions. Usually give ratings that are same as historical ratings. 
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy dramas with compelling storylines.;  appreciate movies with suspense and unexpected twists.;  have a preference for classic movies with timeless appeal.;  enjoy movies that delve into the human condition and explore deep themes.;  have an affinity for foreign films with rich cultural contexts.;  appreciate movies that blend different genres and offer a unique viewing experience.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. I enjoy dramas with compelling storylines, movies with suspense and unexpected twists, and classic movies with timeless appeal. I appreciate movies that delve into the human condition and explore deep themes, as well as foreign films with rich cultural contexts. However, the majority of the movies recommended to me did not align with my preferences. I disliked many of the movies suggested, and even the ones I watched and rated were not entirely satisfying. The system did not seem to understand my selective viewing habits and failed to provide recommendations that matched my taste. Therefore, I cannot rate this recommender system higher than a 3.
