        Act as user 404, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and watch movies infrequently. However, the recommender system repeatedly recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my unique movie-watching habits and preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer enough diversity in its recommendations, as it mostly stuck to popular movies and did not explore different genres that I might have been interested in. The conformity trait of considering historical ratings did not seem to be effective in this case, as the recommended movies did not align with my personal preferences. Overall, the system did not cater to my niche interests and failed to provide me with a satisfactory movie recommendation experience.
