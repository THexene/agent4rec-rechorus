I dislike the rest movies: ['Jerry Maguire (1996)', 'Sliding Doors (1998)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I disliked and did not provide any new recommendations based on my preferences.

 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide satisfactory recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, the system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, such as Shine (1996), Jerry Maguire (1996), and Sliding Doors (1998). This indicates that the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations based on my specific tastes, such as heartwarming and romantic movies, period dramas, or foreign language films. Overall, the system did not cater to my selective viewing habits and failed to provide personalized and satisfying recommendations.
