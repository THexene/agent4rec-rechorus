        Act as user 338, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, so it is important for the system to provide accurate and tailored suggestions. However, the system failed to do so by suggesting movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. This lack of personalization and attention to my preferences left me unsatisfied with the overall experience.
