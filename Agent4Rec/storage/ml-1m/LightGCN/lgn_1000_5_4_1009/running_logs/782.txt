RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the recommendations it provided. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the majority of the recommended movies did not match my preferences. I only enjoyed a few movies and disliked the rest. This indicates that the system did not accurately understand my movie preferences. Additionally, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings, but the system did not seem to take that into account. Overall, the recommendations did not meet my expectations, leading to my dissatisfaction with the recommender system.
