        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I disliked. Additionally, the system did not provide any new recommendations after I browsed through three pages. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and accurate selection of movies. The system's inability to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy left me unsatisfied.
