I dislike the rest movies: ['Clueless (1995)'].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 833, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6
REASON: While the recommender system did provide me with some movie recommendations that aligned with my taste, I found that it quickly ran out of new options for me to explore. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I do appreciate when the system suggests movies that strictly align with my taste. However, after browsing through three pages of recommendations, I had already watched and rated the majority of the suggested movies. This left me with limited new options to explore, which was disappointing. Additionally, as a Balanced Evaluator, I consider both historical ratings and my personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. I found that the system's recommendations were mostly in line with my preferences, but there were a few instances where I disagreed with the historical ratings. Overall, while the recommender system had some strengths, it could benefit from providing a wider variety of recommendations and considering a more diverse range of movies that may not align with my usual taste.
