 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. The system did not accurately capture my diverse and avant-garde taste in movies, as it mostly recommended popular and mainstream films. Additionally, the system heavily relied on historical ratings, which limited the variety of movies suggested to me. Overall, I was not satisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not understand my unique movie preferences.
