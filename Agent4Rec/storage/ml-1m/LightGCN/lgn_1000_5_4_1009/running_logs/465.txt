        Act as user 465, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: Although the recommender system provided me with a variety of movie recommendations, I found that the majority of the movies suggested did not align with my preferences. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommendations to be tailored to my taste. However, the system failed to consistently suggest movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not seem to take this into account. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the recommendations and therefore rate the recommender system a 3.
