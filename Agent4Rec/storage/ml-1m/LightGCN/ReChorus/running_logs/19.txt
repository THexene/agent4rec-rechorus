        Relevant context from user 19's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: F/X 2 (1992), Tao of Steve, The (2000), Psycho Beach Party (2000), Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead (1994), Greaser's Palace (1972), among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively.

- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 19, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I appreciate the effort of the recommender system in suggesting movies, but unfortunately, the recommendations provided on the first page did not align with my specific tastes in action-packed, sci-fi, comedy, epic adventures, and animated delights. As an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I found the selection to be lacking in the genres I prefer. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I tend to evaluate movies solely based on my taste rather than historical ratings, so the recommendations based on historical data did not resonate with me. Overall, I did not feel satisfied with the recommendations and decided to exit the system after browsing just one page.
