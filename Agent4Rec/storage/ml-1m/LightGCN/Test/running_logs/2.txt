        Relevant context from user 2's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Beetlejuice, A Fish Called Wanda, Splash, Little Shop of Horrors, among them, I watched ['A Fish Called Wanda', 'Little Shop of Horrors'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Beetlejuice', 'Splash'].

RATING: 6; REASON: I appreciate the variety of movie options presented to me, including some that aligned with my preferences like "A Fish Called Wanda" and "Little Shop of Horrors." However, I was not fully satisfied as there were still movies recommended that I did not enjoy like "Beetlejuice" and "Splash." Additionally, I felt that the system could have delved deeper into my specific movie tastes to provide more tailored recommendations. Overall, it was a decent experience, but there is room for improvement.
