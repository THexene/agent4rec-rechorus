I dislike the rest movies: ['Crying Game, The (1992)', 'Babe (1995)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the system did not accurately predict my preferences based on the movies I watched and rated on both pages.
        Act as user 2, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. Despite watching and rating movies on both pages, the system still failed to accurately predict my preferences. It recommended movies that were not aligned with my tastes, leading to dissatisfaction with the overall experience. Additionally, the system did not take into account my diverse movie preferences, resulting in a lack of personalized recommendations. Overall, I found the system lacking in understanding my movie preferences and therefore rate it a 3 out of 10.
