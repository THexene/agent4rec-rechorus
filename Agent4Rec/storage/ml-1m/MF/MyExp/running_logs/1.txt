        Relevant context from user 1's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, Shawshank Redemption, The, As Good As It Gets, among them, I watched ['Forrest Gump', 'Saving Private Ryan'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['As Good As It Gets'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Babe, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Get Shorty, Full Monty, The, among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Babe', 'Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery', 'Get Shorty', 'Full Monty, The'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the system did not accurately predict my movie preferences based on my ratings and dislikes from the first page.
        Act as user 1, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. Despite providing ratings and dislikes for the movies recommended on the first page, the system failed to accurately predict my preferences on the second page. This lack of alignment with my tastes led to a disappointing experience, causing me to exit the system without finding suitable movie recommendations. As an Occasional Viewer with a high level of selectivity in my movie choices, I expected the system to better understand and cater to my specific preferences, which it did not achieve in this interaction.
