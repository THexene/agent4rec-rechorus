        Relevant context from user 9's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Schindler's List, Fargo, Terminator, The, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, among them, I watched ['Terminator, The', 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ["Schindler's List", 'Fargo'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Aliens, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Back to the Future, among them, I watched ['Terminator 2: Judgment Day', 'Aliens'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial', 'Back to the Future'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because it keeps suggesting movies that I have already watched and disliked, without offering new options.
        Act as user 9, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because I am incredibly unsatisfied with the recommendations it provided. Despite my clear disliking of certain movies like "Schindler's List" and "Fargo," the system continued to suggest similar films on the subsequent pages. It failed to offer me any new options that align with my movie tastes, making my interaction with the system quite disappointing. Additionally, as an elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for more diverse and tailored recommendations that would pique my interest in watching a movie, but unfortunately, this system fell short in that aspect.
