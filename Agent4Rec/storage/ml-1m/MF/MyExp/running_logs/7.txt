        Relevant context from user 7's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Godfather: Part II, The (1974), Godfather, The (1972), Citizen Kane (1941), Amadeus (1984), among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Annie Hall, Wizard of Oz, The, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Annie Hall', 'Wizard of Oz, The', 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back', 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 7, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 out of 10. I am not satisfied with the recommendations provided as they included movies I had already watched and disliked. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very limited time and interest in watching movies, so when I do decide to watch one, I expect the recommendations to be tailored to my highly selective taste. The lack of personalization and the repetition of movies I had already dismissed greatly impacted my experience with the system. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I value quality over quantity, and the lack of variety in the recommendations further contributed to my dissatisfaction.
