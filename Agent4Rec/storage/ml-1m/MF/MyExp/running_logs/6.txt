        Act as user 6, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: While the recommender system did provide me with a variety of movie recommendations, I found that it often suggested movies that I had already expressed dislike for based on my ratings and preferences. This lack of alignment with my tastes and preferences left me feeling unsatisfied with the overall experience. Additionally, the system did not seem to adapt or learn from my previous interactions, leading to repetitive suggestions that did not resonate with me. Overall, I believe there is room for improvement in the system's ability to accurately recommend movies that align with my specific interests and preferences.
