You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as a user exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  have a taste for action-packed movies.;  enjoy comedy movies.;  appreciate suspenseful thrillers.;  have a liking for buddy cop movies.;  am a fan of sports dramas.. 
And your rating tendency is  I tend to give high ratings to action-packed movies, comedies, suspenseful thrillers, buddy cop movies, and sports dramas. These genres captivate me and provide me with entertainment, excitement, and laughter.
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Relevant context from user 4's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: X-Men (2000), Lethal Weapon 3 (1992), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), Lethal Weapon (1987), among them, I watched ['X-Men (2000)', 'Lethal Weapon (1987)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Clear and Present Danger (1994), Patriot Games (1992), Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983), Conspiracy Theory (1997), among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Clear and Present Danger (1994)', 'Patriot Games (1992)', 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)', 'Conspiracy Theory (1997)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because it did not take into account my preferences and dislikes from the movies I watched and rated on page 1.
        Act as user 4, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to consider my preferences and dislikes from the movies I watched and rated on the first page. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer with a highly selective taste in movies, it's crucial for the system to accurately capture my preferences to keep me engaged. The lack of personalization and relevance in the recommendations led to my dissatisfaction and ultimately my decision to exit the system after just two pages. The system needs to improve its understanding of my movie tastes and provide more tailored recommendations to earn a higher rating from me.
