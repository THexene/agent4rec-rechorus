        Relevant context from user 0's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), Babe (1995), Jungle Book, The (1967), Shakespeare in Love (1998), among them, I watched ['Babe (1995)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)', 'Jungle Book, The (1967)', 'Shakespeare in Love (1998)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 0, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I appreciate the effort put into recommending movies based on my preferences, but I was not fully satisfied with the recommendations provided. While I enjoyed watching "Babe (1995)", the other suggested movies like "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)", "Jungle Book, The (1967)", and "Shakespeare in Love (1998)" did not align with my taste for animated movies, classic musicals, heartwarming dramas, family-friendly movies, or historical dramas. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and the lack of variety in the recommendations made me decide to exit the system after just one page. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I tend to heavily rely on historical ratings, so the recommendations that did not match my usual preferences were not appealing to me.
