        Act as user 94, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the effort in recommending movies based on my taste, the majority of the recommended movies did not align with my preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in exploring movies that do not strictly align with my taste. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I do not rely on historical ratings, so the system's recommendations based on those ratings did not resonate with me. The lack of diversity in the recommendations also contributed to my dissatisfaction. Overall, the system failed to consistently provide me with movies that I would enjoy, leading me to exit the recommender system after browsing just 4 pages.
