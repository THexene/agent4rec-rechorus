 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it kept suggesting similar movies within the same genre. As a Maverick Critic, I rely on my own taste rather than historical ratings, so the system's reliance on those ratings did not align with my preferences. Overall, the recommender system did not cater to my unique movie-watching habits and taste, leading to my dissatisfaction and decision to exit the system.
