        Relevant context from user 61's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Casablanca, Saving Private Ryan, among them, I watched ['E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial', 'Casablanca'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ["Schindler's List", 'Saving Private Ryan'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.

        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did suggest a couple of movies that aligned with my preferences, such as "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" and "Casablanca," I was disappointed that it recommended movies like "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan," which are not my preferred genres. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it's crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences. Additionally, I found the lack of variety in the recommendations to be underwhelming. Overall, the system did not fully meet my expectations, resulting in a lower rating.
