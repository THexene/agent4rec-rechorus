        Act as user 85, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste, and unfortunately, this system did not consistently provide me with satisfying recommendations. Additionally, I found that I had already watched and rated a significant number of the recommended movies, which further decreased my satisfaction with the system. Overall, I believe there is room for improvement in terms of understanding and catering to my specific movie preferences.
