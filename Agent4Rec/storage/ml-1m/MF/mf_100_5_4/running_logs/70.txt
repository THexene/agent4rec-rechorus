I dislike the rest movies: ['Wedding Singer, The', 'Jerry Maguire'].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 70, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it kept suggesting similar genres and themes that I have already indicated a preference for. As a Maverick Critic, I rely on my own taste and do not conform to historical ratings, so the system's reliance on those ratings was not helpful to me. Overall, the system did not cater to my unique movie-watching habits and failed to provide me with satisfying recommendations.
