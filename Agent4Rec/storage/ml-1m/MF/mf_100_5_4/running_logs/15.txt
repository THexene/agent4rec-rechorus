 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am extremely unsatisfied with the recommender system. Despite my incredibly infrequent movie-watching habits, the system failed to understand my elusive nature and recommended movies that did not align with my taste at all. The system's lack of understanding of my preferences, combined with its reliance on historical ratings, resulted in a poor selection of movies that I disliked. Additionally, the system did not provide any alternative options or suggestions that could have catered to my selective taste. As a maverick critic, I expected the recommender system to prioritize my individual taste over popular opinion, but it failed to do so. Overall, the system's inability to accurately recommend movies that I would enjoy and its disregard for my unique preferences make it a highly unsatisfactory experience.
