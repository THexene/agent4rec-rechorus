        Act as user 65, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 4 because it failed to meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer. The system recommended movies that I had already expressed dislike for on multiple occasions, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it consistently suggested movies from genres that align with my usual taste. As a result, I did not feel satisfied with the recommender system and decided to exit after browsing just three pages.
