        Act as user 49, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4. While it did recommend a few movies that aligned with my taste, there were also a significant number of movies that I disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I have limited patience for recommendations that don't consistently match my preferences. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I have a high standard for the movies I choose to watch, and this system didn't consistently meet that standard. Although it took into account both historical ratings and personal preferences, it still fell short in providing me with a satisfying selection of movies.
