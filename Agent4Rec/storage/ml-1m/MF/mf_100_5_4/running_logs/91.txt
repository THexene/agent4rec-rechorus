        Relevant context from user 91's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Runaway Bride, Titanic, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Blair Witch Project, The, among them, I watched ['Runaway Bride', 'Titanic'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively.

- Turn to page 3 of the recommendation.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I disliked and did not provide any new recommendations.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 3: Babe (1995), American Beauty (1999), Men in Black (1997), Wedding Singer, The (1998), among them, I watched ['Wedding Singer, The (1998)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['American Beauty (1999)', 'Men in Black (1997)'].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 91, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and watch movies infrequently. However, the system did not take into account my movie-watching habits and recommended movies that I had already expressed dislike for. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations after three pages, which left me feeling unsatisfied. As a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not seem to consider this aspect either. Overall, the lack of personalization and failure to understand my preferences led to a disappointing experience.
