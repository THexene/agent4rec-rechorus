        Relevant context from user 90's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Princess Bride, The (1987), Jurassic Park (1993), American Beauty (1999), Ghostbusters (1984), among them, I watched ['Princess Bride, The (1987)', 'Jurassic Park (1993)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['American Beauty (1999)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Braveheart (1995), Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999), Arachnophobia (1990), among them, I watched ['Braveheart (1995)', 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Arachnophobia (1990)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not take into account my dislike for certain movies and continued to recommend them.
        Act as user 90, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not take into account my dislikes and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and it is important for the recommender system to respect those preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it continued to suggest movies from the same genres that I had already watched and rated. I appreciate the system considering historical ratings and personal preferences, but it should also take into account the user's explicit dislikes to provide a more tailored and satisfying experience.
