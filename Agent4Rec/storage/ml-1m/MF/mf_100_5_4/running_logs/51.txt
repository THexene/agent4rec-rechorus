        Act as user 51, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I did find a couple of movies that I enjoyed, the majority of the recommendations did not align with my taste. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommendations to be spot-on. However, the system failed to consistently suggest movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not seem to take that into account. Overall, the lack of satisfaction and relevance in the recommendations led me to exit the system after browsing just three pages.
