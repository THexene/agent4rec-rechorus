RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and infrequent movie-watching habits. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my tastes, such as "American Beauty" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," it also recommended movies like "Fargo" that I disliked. This indicates that the system did not fully understand my preferences and failed to provide accurate recommendations. Additionally, the system did not offer enough variety in its recommendations, as it repeatedly suggested movies from genres I am not interested in. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt the system did not cater to my unique movie-watching habits and preferences.
