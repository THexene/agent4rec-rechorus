 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system provided some movie recommendations that aligned with my taste, such as "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" and "Saving Private Ryan," which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, the system failed to provide new recommendations on multiple occasions, which was disappointing. Additionally, I felt that the system relied too heavily on historical ratings, as many of the recommended movies were popular and well-known. As a Cinematic Trailblazer, I was hoping for more unique and obscure movie suggestions. Overall, while the system had its moments, it did not fully satisfy my preferences and lacked the diversity I was seeking.
