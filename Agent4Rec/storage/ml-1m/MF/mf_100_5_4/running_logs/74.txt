        Relevant context from user 74's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: The Graduate (1967), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Run Lola Run (Lola rennt) (1998), Ghostbusters (1984), among them, I watched ['The Graduate (1967)', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Ghostbusters (1984)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: American Beauty (1999), Life Is Beautiful (La Vita ï¿½ bella) (1997), Breakfast Club, The (1985), Being John Malkovich (1999), among them, I watched ['American Beauty (1999)', 'Life Is Beautiful (La Vita ï¿½ bella) (1997)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Breakfast Club, The (1985)', 'Being John Malkovich (1999)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 74, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and left me unsatisfied. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, this recommender system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my movie-watching habits and preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide any variety or diversity in its recommendations, which is important to me as an exceedingly discerning selective viewer. Overall, the system did not effectively cater to my unique tastes and failed to provide me with new and interesting movie suggestions.
