        Act as user 28, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite considering my personal preferences and historical ratings, the system still recommended movies that I did not enjoy. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences, and I expect the recommender system to understand and cater to those preferences. However, the system failed to consistently recommend movies that aligned with my taste for classic comedies, action-packed and adventurous films, light-hearted romantic comedies, quirky and unconventional movies, and musicals with catchy soundtracks. Additionally, the system did not take into account my dislike for certain genres or movies. Therefore, I am disappointed with the recommendations and find the system unsatisfactory.
