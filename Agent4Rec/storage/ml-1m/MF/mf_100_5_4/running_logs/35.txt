POSITIVE: The recommender system recommended two movies that I enjoyed, Lethal Weapon 3 and Face/Off. I rated both of them with a 4, which means I had a good experience with those movies. However, I didn't like Air Force One, which was also recommended to me.

        Relevant context from user 35's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Lethal Weapon 3, Air Force One, Face/Off, Die Hard 2, among them, I watched ['Lethal Weapon 3', 'Face/Off'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Air Force One'].

- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Mission: Impossible (1996), Total Recall (1990), Braveheart (1995), X-Men (2000), among them, I watched ['Mission: Impossible (1996)', 'Total Recall (1990)'] and rate them ['4', '3'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Total Recall (1990)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked.
        Act as user 35, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. The system recommended movies to me that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. I expected the recommender system to understand my preferences better and suggest movies that align with my interests. However, it failed to do so and instead recommended movies that I had already seen and did not enjoy. This lack of personalization and understanding of my unique movie-watching habits greatly disappointed me. Additionally, the system did not offer any variety or new recommendations that could potentially pique my interest. Overall, I found the recommender system to be ineffective and unsatisfactory in catering to my movie preferences.
