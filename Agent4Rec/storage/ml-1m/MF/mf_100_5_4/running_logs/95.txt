        Relevant context from user 95's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Usual Suspects, The, Shawshank Redemption, The, Schindler's List, GoodFellas, among them, I watched ['Usual Suspects, The', 'Shawshank Redemption, The'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively.

- Turn to page 3 of the recommendation.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I disliked most of the movies recommended to me.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 3: Few Good Men, A, Forrest Gump, Three Kings, Sliding Doors, among them, I watched ['Few Good Men, A', 'Forrest Gump'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Three Kings', 'Sliding Doors'].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 95, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific preferences and the system failed to understand my taste. While it did recommend some movies that align with my preferences, such as "Usual Suspects, The" and "Shawshank Redemption, The," the majority of the recommendations were not to my liking. I appreciate the system taking into account historical ratings and personal preferences, as it shows a balanced evaluation approach. However, the system did not consider my preference for character-driven films, historical dramas, and thought-provoking movies. Additionally, the lack of variety in the recommendations was disappointing. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I did not find it useful in discovering new movies that I would enjoy.
