        Act as user 11, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: Although I appreciate the effort of the recommender system in providing movie recommendations, I am not satisfied with the results. The system recommended movies that I had already expressed dislike for, and it did not offer any new recommendations based on my preferences. As a Movie Enthusiast, I rely on recommender systems to discover new and exciting films that align with my diverse taste. However, this system failed to deliver on that front. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and not historical ratings. The system's reliance on historical ratings did not align with my preferences, resulting in recommendations that did not resonate with me. Overall, while I appreciate the effort, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and fell short in providing personalized and diverse movie recommendations.
