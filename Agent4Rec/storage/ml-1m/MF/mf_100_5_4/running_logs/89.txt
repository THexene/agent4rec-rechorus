        Relevant context from user 89's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Terminator, The, Godfather, The, American Beauty, among them, I watched ['Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Terminator, The'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].

- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I had already watched and rated most of the movies suggested to me.
        Act as user 89, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While the system did recommend some movies that align with my interests, such as action-packed and science fiction films, it failed to offer enough variety or options that I haven't already watched. 

Additionally, as a Balanced Evaluator, I take into consideration both historical ratings and my personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. However, the system seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings, which may not always align with my own opinions. This lack of consideration for my individual preferences made the recommendations less appealing to me.

Furthermore, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I expect the recommender system to provide me with movies that are meticulously curated to match my personal taste. However, the system seemed to overlook this aspect and instead offered movies that I had already watched and rated.

Overall, I feel unsatisfied with the recommender system as it failed to provide me with new and diverse movie options that align with my specific interests and preferences.
