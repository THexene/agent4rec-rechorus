 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to satisfy my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the system recommended several movies that I disliked, such as Gladiator (2000), Abyss, The (1989), and Twister (1996). Despite finding a few movies that I enjoyed, like Jurassic Park (1993) and Total Recall (1990), the majority of the recommendations did not meet my expectations. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not consistently provide movies with high historical ratings. Overall, the lack of satisfaction and alignment with my preferences leads me to rate this recommender system a 3.
