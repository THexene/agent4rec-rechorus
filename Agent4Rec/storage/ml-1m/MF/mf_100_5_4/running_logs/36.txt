        Relevant context from user 36's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Terminator 2: Judgment Day, High Fidelity, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, Matrix, The, among them, I watched ['Terminator 2: Judgment Day', 'Matrix, The'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['High Fidelity'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Men in Black, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Almost Famous, among them, I watched ['Men in Black', 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace', 'Almost Famous'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I disliked some of the movies recommended to me and only enjoyed a few of them.
        Act as user 36, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While I did enjoy a couple of the movies recommended to me, such as "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and "The Matrix," the majority of the recommendations did not align with my preferences. I disliked movies like "High Fidelity," "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," and "Almost Famous." 

Furthermore, as a Maverick Critic, I do not rely on historical ratings to evaluate movies. I evaluate them solely based on my own taste. However, it seems that this recommender system heavily relies on historical ratings, which is not aligned with my conformity trait. This led to a mismatch between the recommended movies and my personal preferences.

Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I expect a high level of curation and exclusivity in the movie choices presented to me. Unfortunately, the recommender system did not meet this expectation. It recommended movies that did not match my affinity for thrilling and action-packed movies, thought-provoking and critically acclaimed films, historical and adventure movies, suspenseful and mysterious movies, and science fiction and fantasy movies.

Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system's ability to understand and cater to my unique movie preferences. It failed to provide me with a satisfactory selection of movies, resulting in a low rating of 3.
