[EXIT]; Reason: The recommender system has failed to meet my expectations and I am very tired.

You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 40 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  Classic Films Enthusiast;  Romantic Drama Lover;  Historical Epics Admirer;  Musical Enthusiast. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 40, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While the system did recommend some movies that aligned with my preferences, it also suggested movies that I disliked. This indicates that the system did not fully understand my movie preferences and failed to provide accurate recommendations. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations based on my previous choices, which further contributed to my dissatisfaction. As a result, I am not inclined to continue using this recommender system.
