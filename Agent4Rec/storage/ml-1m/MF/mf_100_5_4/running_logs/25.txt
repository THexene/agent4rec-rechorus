        Act as user 25, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie tastes, and this system failed to understand and cater to my preferences. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the system recommended movies that did not align with my interests. Additionally, the system repeated recommendations that I had already watched and rated, which was disappointing. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations.
