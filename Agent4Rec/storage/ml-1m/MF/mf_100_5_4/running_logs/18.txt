RATING: 5; REASON: The recommender system had some hits and misses. While it recommended movies like "Schindler's List" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies like "GoodFellas" and "Jerry Maguire" that I didn't enjoy. The system did take into account my ratings and preferences, but it still recommended movies that I disliked on the first page. Overall, the system had a decent understanding of my taste, but it could have been more accurate in its recommendations.
