        Act as user 63, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in watching movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the majority of the movies recommended to me were not to my liking. Despite the system taking into account my preferences for romantic comedies, action-packed thrillers, nostalgic classics, suspenseful mysteries, clever and witty comedies, and feel-good family movies, it failed to consistently recommend movies that I enjoyed. Additionally, the system did not seem to consider my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As a result, I felt unsatisfied with the recommendations and decided to exit the system after browsing through five pages.
