RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did suggest some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked.

Additionally, the system did not provide enough diverse and avant-garde movie recommendations, which is something I value as a Cinematic Trailblazer. Overall, the system failed to consistently meet my expectations and provide satisfactory recommendations.
