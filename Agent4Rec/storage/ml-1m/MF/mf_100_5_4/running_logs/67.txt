        Relevant context from user 67's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Princess Bride, The (1987), American Beauty (1999), Back to the Future (1985), Ghostbusters (1984), among them, I watched ['Princess Bride, The (1987)', 'American Beauty (1999)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively.

- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.

        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: Although I found the movie recommendations to be somewhat aligned with my preferences, I was not completely satisfied with the recommender system. The system did suggest a couple of movies that I enjoyed, such as "Princess Bride, The" and "American Beauty," but it also recommended movies like "Ghostbusters" which I did not like at all. Additionally, I felt that the system could have provided more options that catered to my specific movie tastes, such as action-packed thrillers, time-travel plots, and sci-fi adventures. Overall, while the recommender system had some hits, it missed the mark on a few occasions, leading to my dissatisfaction.
