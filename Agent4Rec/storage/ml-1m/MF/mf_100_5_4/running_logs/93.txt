 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4. While it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," there were also a significant number of recommendations that I did not enjoy, like "Braveheart" and "Men in Black." The system did not seem to fully understand my preferences and failed to consistently provide me with satisfying recommendations. Additionally, the system did not offer enough diversity in its recommendations, as it mainly suggested popular and mainstream movies. Overall, I was not completely satisfied with the recommender system's performance.
