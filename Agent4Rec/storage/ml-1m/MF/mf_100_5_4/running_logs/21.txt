        Act as user 21, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to satisfy my movie preferences. As an Occasional Viewer, I am only interested in movies that strictly align with my taste. However, the majority of the movies recommended to me did not match my preferences. Despite watching and enjoying a few movies, such as Braveheart and Jurassic Park, the system consistently recommended movies that I disliked, such as Mission: Impossible and Speed. This lack of alignment with my taste made me lose interest in the system after browsing through three pages. As a result, I did not find the recommender system to be effective in catering to my movie preferences.
