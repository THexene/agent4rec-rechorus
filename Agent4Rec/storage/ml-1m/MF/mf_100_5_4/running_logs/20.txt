RATING: 6
REASON: While I appreciate the effort of the recommender system in suggesting movies based on my preferences, I am not completely satisfied with the results. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and rated, which was disappointing. Additionally, there were some movies in the recommendations that I did not enjoy. However, I did find a few movies that I really liked and rated highly. Overall, the system has potential, but it needs to improve its ability to avoid suggesting movies that I have already seen and disliked.
