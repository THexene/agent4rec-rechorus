        Act as user 12, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific and diverse movie tastes, and this system failed to cater to my preferences. Despite my inclination towards thrilling and suspenseful movies, coming-of-age and nostalgic movies, comedy films, thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating movies, historical and epic movies, and movies with strong female leads, the majority of the recommended movies did not align with these preferences. 

Furthermore, as a Maverick Critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and disregard historical ratings. However, the system seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings in its recommendations, which resulted in movies that I did not enjoy. This lack of conformity to my taste further contributed to my dissatisfaction.

Additionally, as a Cinematic Trailblazer, I seek out unique and obscure movies. Unfortunately, the system did not provide any new options on subsequent pages, which limited my exploration of diverse and avant-garde films.

Overall, the recommender system failed to understand and cater to my unique movie preferences, resulting in a lack of satisfaction.
