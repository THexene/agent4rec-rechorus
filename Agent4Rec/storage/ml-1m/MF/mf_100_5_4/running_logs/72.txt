        Act as user 72, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to consistently align with my movie preferences. While it did recommend some movies that I enjoyed and rated highly, there were also many instances where it suggested movies that I disliked. This inconsistency made it difficult for me to trust the recommendations and ultimately led to my dissatisfaction with the system. Additionally, the fact that the system continued to suggest movies I had already expressed disinterest in on multiple pages further decreased my confidence in its ability to understand my preferences. As an occasional viewer with a highly selective taste, I expect a recommender system to accurately cater to my preferences and provide recommendations that align with my specific movie genres. Unfortunately, this system fell short in meeting those expectations.
