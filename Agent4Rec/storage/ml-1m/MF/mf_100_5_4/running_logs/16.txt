RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and rarely watch movies. However, the recommender system failed to take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits and recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. This shows a lack of understanding of my preferences and a failure to provide me with new and exciting movie options. Additionally, the system did not offer any variety or diversity in its recommendations, which is important to me as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer. Overall, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system's performance and its inability to cater to my unique movie preferences.
