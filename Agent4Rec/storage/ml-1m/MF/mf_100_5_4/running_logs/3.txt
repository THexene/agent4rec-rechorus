 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. However, the system seemed to ignore my preferences and recommended movies that I had no interest in. Despite watching a few movies and providing my own ratings, the system did not seem to adapt or improve its recommendations based on my feedback. Additionally, as a Maverick Critic, I do not rely on historical ratings and prefer to evaluate movies based on my own taste. Unfortunately, the system did not take this into account and continued to recommend movies solely based on historical ratings. Overall, the lack of personalization and disregard for my unique movie preferences left me unsatisfied with this recommender system.
