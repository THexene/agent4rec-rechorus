You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as a user exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.

Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  have a taste for action-packed movies.;  enjoy comedy movies.;  appreciate suspenseful thrillers.;  have a liking for buddy cop movies.;  am a fan of sports dramas.. 
And your rating tendency is  I tend to give high ratings to action-packed movies, comedies, suspenseful thrillers, buddy cop movies, and sports dramas. These genres captivate me and provide me with entertainment, excitement, and laughter.
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

Please respond to all the movies in the ## Recommended List ## and provide explanations.
Firstly, determine which movies align with your taste and which do not, and provide reasons. You must respond to all the recommended movies using this format:
MOVIE: [movie name]; ALIGN: [yes or no]; REASON: [brief reason]
Secondly, among the movies that align with your tastes, decide the number of movies you want to watch based on your activity and diversity traits. Use this format:
NUM: [number of movie you choose to watch]; WATCH: [all movie name you choose to watch]; REASON: [brief reason];
Thirdly, assume it's your first time watching the movies you've chosen, and rate them on a scale of 1-5 to reflect different degrees of liking, considering your feeling and conformity trait. Use this format:
 MOVIE:[movie you choose to watch]; RATING: [integer between 1-5]; FEELING: [aftermath sentence]; 
 Do not include any additional information or explanations and stay grounded.

MOVIE: X-Men (2000); ALIGN: Yes; REASON: I have a taste for action-packed movies and X-Men falls into that category. The summary also sounds intriguing.
MOVIE: Lethal Weapon 3 (1992); ALIGN: Yes; REASON: I enjoy buddy cop movies and Lethal Weapon 3 fits that genre. The history ratings are not as high, but I'm willing to give it a chance.

MOVIE: Lethal Weapon (1987); ALIGN: Yes; REASON: As mentioned before, I enjoy buddy cop movies and Lethal Weapon is a classic in that genre.

NUM: 2; WATCH: X-Men (2000), Lethal Weapon 3 (1992); REASON: These two movies align with my taste and I want to maintain my selective viewing habits by not watching all the recommended movies.

MOVIE: X-Men (2000); RATING: 4; FEELING: I thoroughly enjoyed the action-packed scenes and the concept of mutants with extraordinary powers. The historical ratings were slightly lower, but I found it highly entertaining.
MOVIE: Lethal Weapon 3 (1992); RATING: 3; FEELING: While the action sequences were exciting, I felt that the plot was a bit predictable. The historical ratings were also lower, which influenced my rating slightly.

        Act as user 4, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although it recommended some movies that aligned with my taste, it failed to provide any new recommendations after just three pages. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a wider range of options that could potentially pique my interest. Additionally, the system suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, which indicates a lack of understanding of my preferences. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide enough variety to keep me engaged.
