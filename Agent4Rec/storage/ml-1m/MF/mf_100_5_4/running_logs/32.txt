        Relevant context from user 32's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Matrix, The (1999), You've Got Mail (1998), Shawshank Redemption, The (1994), Aladdin (1992), among them, I watched ["You've Got Mail (1998)", 'Aladdin (1992)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Matrix, The (1999)', 'Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 32, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: Although the recommender system did suggest a couple of movies that I ended up enjoying, the overall experience was not satisfying. The system recommended movies that were not aligned with my preferences, such as "Matrix, The (1999)" and "Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)", which I did not like. Additionally, the system only provided me with one page of recommendations, which limited my options. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more tailored and diverse selection of movies that matched my taste. Therefore, I rate this recommender system a 4.
