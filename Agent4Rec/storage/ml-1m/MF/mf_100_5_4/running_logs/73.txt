RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not accurately predict my movie preferences based on the movies I watched and rated. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. While I appreciate the diversity of movie recommendations, the system failed to understand my unique and eclectic taste. Additionally, as a Dedicated Follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings when giving my own ratings. However, the system did not take this into account and recommended movies that did not align with my usual preferences. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not understand my movie-watching habits and preferences.
