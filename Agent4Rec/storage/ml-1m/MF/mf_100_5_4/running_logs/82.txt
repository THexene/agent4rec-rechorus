        Relevant context from user 82's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Alien (1979), Matrix, The (1999), Jurassic Park (1993), Frequency (2000), among them, I watched ['Alien (1979)', 'Matrix, The (1999)', 'Jurassic Park (1993)'] and rate them ['4', '5', '4'] respectively.

- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Patriot, The (2000), Hellraiser (1987), Rocky (1976), Schindler's List (1993), among them, I watched ['Patriot, The (2000)', 'Rocky (1976)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Hellraiser (1987)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender did not accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked.
        Act as user 82, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not accurately understand my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I disliked. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and infrequent movie-watching habits. While I appreciate the effort to recommend movies that align with my diverse and avant-garde preferences, the system failed to take into account my enjoyment of horror, fantasy, adventure, classic, nostalgic, action-packed, thrilling, and comedy movies. The recommendations on both pages did not fully capture my interests, resulting in a lack of satisfaction. Additionally, the system did not consider my balanced evaluation approach, as it continued to recommend movies that had low historical ratings. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a personalized and accurate movie recommendation experience.
