        Relevant context from user 17's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Forrest Gump, Lethal Weapon, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Casablanca, among them, I watched ['Forrest Gump'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Lethal Weapon', 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 17, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Despite being an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, the system failed to understand my movie preferences and recommended movies that did not align with my tastes. The only movie I watched and enjoyed was Forrest Gump, but the system also suggested movies like Lethal Weapon and Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, which I did not like at all. As a maverick critic, I evaluate movies solely based on my own taste and ignore historical ratings. However, the system seemed to heavily rely on historical ratings, which resulted in recommendations that were not suitable for me. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it only suggested a few genres that I am interested in. Overall, the recommender system did not meet my expectations and I will not be using it again.
