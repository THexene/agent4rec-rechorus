        Act as user 33, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because it failed to consistently recommend movies that aligned with my taste. While I did enjoy some of the movies it suggested, there were also many that I disliked and had no interest in watching. The system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. As an occasional viewer, it is important for me to have a system that understands and caters to my specific tastes, and unfortunately, this recommender system fell short in that regard.
