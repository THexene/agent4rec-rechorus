RATING: 3
REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. However, the system failed to understand my taste and kept recommending movies that I disliked. Despite giving ratings heavily influenced by historical ratings, the system did not take into account my selectivity and preference for specific genres. It lacked the ability to curate recommendations that align with my taste for animated movies with adventure and fantasy, classic musicals with romance and elegance, heartwarming dramas with inspiration and emotion, family-friendly movies with nostalgia and imagination, and historical dramas with suspense and intrigue. The lack of variety and understanding of my preferences left me unsatisfied with the recommender system.
