 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but I was curious to see if this system could align with my taste. However, I found that the recommendations provided were not tailored enough to my preferences. The system suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and it did not offer any new recommendations that I enjoyed. This lack of personalization and variety left me unsatisfied. Additionally, the system did not take into account my activity trait, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already rated and disliked. Overall, the system did not effectively cater to my selective viewing habits and failed to provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
