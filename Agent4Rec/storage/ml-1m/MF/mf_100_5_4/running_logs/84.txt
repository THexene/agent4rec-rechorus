        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific and selective tastes when it comes to movies. I enjoy movies with a dark and intense atmosphere, ones that explore complex relationships and human psychology, and those that blend comedy and drama. However, the recommendations I received did not align with my preferences at all. The majority of the movies recommended to me were ones that I disliked, and there were very few that I actually watched and enjoyed. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my Maverick Critic conformity trait, as the recommended movies were based solely on historical ratings rather than my own taste. Overall, this recommender system did not cater to my unique preferences and failed to provide me with satisfying movie recommendations.
