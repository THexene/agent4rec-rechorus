        Act as user 80, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific and selective tastes when it comes to movies. However, the system recommended movies that did not align with my preferences, resulting in a majority of movies that I disliked. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the system still failed to accurately recommend movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, the infrequency of my movie-watching habits makes it crucial for the recommender system to provide highly tailored and accurate recommendations, which it did not do. Therefore, I am unsatisfied with the recommender system and would not rely on it for future movie suggestions.
