- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Annie Hall (1977), Wizard of Oz, The (1939), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), among them, I watched ['Annie Hall (1977)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Wizard of Oz, The (1939)', 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)', 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the recommender suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked, and did not provide any new recommendations that I might be interested in.
        Act as user 7, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, without providing any new recommendations that might align with my taste. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific preferences and the system failed to understand and cater to them. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and preferences, as it suggested movies that were not in line with my enjoyment of classic movies, thought-provoking dramas, and well-crafted films. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with any valuable recommendations.
