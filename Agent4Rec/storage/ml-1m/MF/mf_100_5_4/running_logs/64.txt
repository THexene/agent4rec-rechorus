        Act as user 64, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system provided some movies that aligned with my taste, such as "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Pulp Fiction," which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, there were also many movies that I disliked and had to skip, such as "Silence of the Lambs" and "L.A. Confidential." The system did not seem to learn from my preferences and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed dislike for. Additionally, the system did not offer any new recommendations based on my preferences after a few pages of browsing. Overall, while the system had some hits, it lacked personalization and failed to consistently provide satisfying recommendations.
