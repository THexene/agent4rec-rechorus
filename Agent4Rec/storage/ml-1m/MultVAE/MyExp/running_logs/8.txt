I dislike the rest movies: ['Secrets & Lies (1996)'].
- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 8, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer with highly selective movie preferences. While I appreciated the inclusion of some critically acclaimed and thought-provoking films like "Shakespeare in Love" and "Being John Malkovich," the majority of the recommendations did not align with my taste for dramatic and emotionally engaging storylines. The system failed to accurately capture my preference for a mix of humor and romance, as well as intriguing and unconventional narratives. Additionally, the lack of action and adventure elements in the recommendations further contributed to my dissatisfaction. Overall, the system's inability to consistently suggest movies that resonate with my specific criteria resulted in a low rating.
