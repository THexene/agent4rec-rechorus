        Relevant context from user 9's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), Back to the Future (1985), Sixth Sense, The (1999), among them, I watched ['Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)', 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Back to the Future (1985)', 'Sixth Sense, The (1999)'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Jurassic Park (1993), Silence of the Lambs, The (1991), Godfather, The (1972), among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: [].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because I have already watched and rated the majority of the recommended movies, leaving me with limited new options to explore.
        Act as user 9, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 out of 10. I am not satisfied with the system as it did not offer me enough new movie options to explore. Despite my rare movie-watching habits, the system recommended movies that I had already watched and rated, leaving me with limited choices for new experiences. Additionally, the system did not cater well to my diverse taste as it mainly suggested popular and well-known movies, which did not align with my niche explorer characteristic. Overall, I found the recommendations to be repetitive and lacking in variety, leading to my decision to exit the system unsatisfied.
