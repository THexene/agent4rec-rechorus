        Relevant context from user 7's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Annie Hall, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Serpico, Amadeus, among them, I watched ["One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", 'Amadeus'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Annie Hall', 'Serpico'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1963), Chinatown (1974), African Queen, The (1951), Grapes of Wrath, The (1940), among them, I watched ['Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1963)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['African Queen, The (1951)', 'Grapes of Wrath, The (1940)'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because the system recommended movies that I disliked and did not align with my preferences.
        Act as user 7, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to accurately recommend movies that align with my highly selective and specific tastes. Despite watching and enjoying "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Amadeus" from the first page recommendations, the system continued to suggest movies like "Annie Hall" and "Serpico" on the second page, which I disliked. This lack of understanding of my preferences and the repeated recommendations of movies that did not match my taste left me unsatisfied with the overall experience. The system needs to improve its ability to recommend movies that cater to my love for classic, thought-provoking, and intense films to receive a higher rating from me.
