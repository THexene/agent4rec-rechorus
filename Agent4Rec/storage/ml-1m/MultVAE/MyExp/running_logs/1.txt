        Relevant context from user 1's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Silence of the Lambs, The (1991), Forrest Gump (1994), Being John Malkovich (1999), Shawshank Redemption, The (1994), among them, I watched ['Forrest Gump (1994)', 'Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)', 'Being John Malkovich (1999)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 1, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 7; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 7. While I appreciate the accuracy in recommending movies like "Forrest Gump" and "Shawshank Redemption" that align with my taste for thought-provoking dramas and historical films, I was not satisfied with the recommendations of "Silence of the Lambs" and "Being John Malkovich" which are not in line with my preferences. The system did a decent job overall, but the lack of consistency in aligning all recommendations with my taste made me decide to exit after just one page.
