I dislike the rest movies: ['Dog Day Afternoon (1975)', 'Full Metal Jacket (1987)'].

- After browsing 3 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 8, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer with a highly selective taste in movies. While I appreciated the mix of genres and the attempt to cater to my preferences, the system failed to consistently recommend movies that aligned with my specific interests. Despite providing ratings and feedback on the movies I watched, the system continued to suggest films that I had already indicated disliking. This lack of personalization and understanding of my unique movie taste left me feeling unsatisfied and ultimately led me to exit the system after browsing through three pages. In the future, I hope the recommender system can better adapt to my discerning and exclusive viewing habits to provide more accurate and tailored recommendations.
