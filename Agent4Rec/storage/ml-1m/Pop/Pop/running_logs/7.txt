        Relevant context from user 7's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Dances with Wolves (1990), Heavy Metal (1981), Casablanca (1942), Jackie Brown (1997), among them, I watched ['Dances with Wolves (1990)', 'Casablanca (1942)'] and rate them ['4', '5'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Heavy Metal (1981)'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 7, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 7; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 7 out of 10. While I appreciate the recommendations for "Dances with Wolves" and "Casablanca," which align with my preferences for classic, well-crafted movies, I was not satisfied with the recommendation for "Heavy Metal," as it does not match my taste at all. The system did a decent job of considering my personal preferences, but there is room for improvement in filtering out recommendations that are not in line with my selective viewing habits. Overall, it was a satisfactory experience, but not perfect.
