        Relevant context from user 4's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Army of Darkness, Risky Business, Boat, The (Das Boot), Scent of a Woman, among them, I watched [] and rate them [] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Army of Darkness', 'Risky Business', 'Boat, The (Das Boot)', 'Scent of a Woman'].
- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 4, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 5; REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 5. While it did recommend a few movies that aligned with my tastes, such as "The Boat (Das Boot)," it also suggested movies like "Army of Darkness" and "Risky Business" which are not my cup of tea. I appreciate the mix of recommendations, but ultimately, the lack of precision in catering to my specific movie preferences left me feeling somewhat unsatisfied.
