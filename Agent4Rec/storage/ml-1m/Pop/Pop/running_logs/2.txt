        Relevant context from user 2's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Out of Sight (1998), Bringing Out the Dead (1999), Little Mermaid, The (1989), Mission: Impossible 2 (2000), among them, I watched ['Mission: Impossible 2 (2000)'] and rate them ['4'] respectively.

- After browsing 1 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
        Act as user 2, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:

 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 6; REASON: The recommender system provided a mix of movie recommendations, including some that aligned with my preferences like "Mission: Impossible 2 (2000)". However, there were also suggestions like "Out of Sight (1998)", "Bringing Out the Dead (1999)", and "Little Mermaid, The (1989)" which were not to my liking. While I appreciate the variety, the system could have been more accurate in predicting my tastes based on my previous ratings. Overall, it was an okay experience, but there is room for improvement in tailoring recommendations to my specific movie preferences.
