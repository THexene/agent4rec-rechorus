        Relevant context from user 9's memory:
        - The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 1: Wedding Singer, The, Chinatown, Wag the Dog, Breakfast at Tiffany's, among them, I watched ['Chinatown', "Breakfast at Tiffany's"] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Wedding Singer, The', 'Wag the Dog'].
- Turn to page 2 of the recommendation.
- The recommender recommended the following movies to me on page 2: Toy Story 2, Hoosiers, Men in Black, French Connection, The, among them, I watched ['Men in Black', 'French Connection, The'] and rate them ['4', '4'] respectively. I dislike the rest movies: ['Toy Story 2', 'Hoosiers'].
- After browsing 2 pages, I decided to leave the recommendation system.
- Unsatisfied with the recommendation result because it recommended movies that I disliked on both pages, despite me providing ratings for the movies I watched.
        Act as user 9, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer. Despite providing ratings for the movies I watched, the system continued to recommend movies that I disliked on both pages. As a Maverick Critic who evaluates movies solely based on my own taste and ignores historical ratings, I was disappointed that the system did not seem to take my preferences into account. Additionally, as a Niche Explorer who occasionally explores different genres, I was hoping for a more diverse selection of recommendations that aligned with my varied movie tastes. Overall, the lack of personalization and failure to cater to my unique preferences led to my dissatisfaction with the recommender system.
